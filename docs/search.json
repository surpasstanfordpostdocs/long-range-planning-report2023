    "text": "Bylaws of the Stanford University Postdoctoral Association\n\nHistory\nThe Stanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS) was founded in 1998 to promote a community among Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford University. SURPAS is governed by the Council. The Council was formed in Spring of 1999, and addresses issues related to Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford. The Council functions in advocacy and helps to maintain a social structure within the postdoctoral community.\nNote: The Stanford University Postdoctoral Association previously used the acronym SUPD, which was often confused with the Stanford University Police Department. In 2013, the Council appointed a Name and Logo committee to report on the name confusion and potential alternatives. The committee reported that even though the Stanford Police department uses the acronym SUDPS, or Stanford University Department of Public Safety, confusion still occurs, and many alternative acronyms were already claimed by other organizations at Stanford. For instance, SUPA was already used by the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Association. The acronym SURPAS was identified as a viable alternative, which sounds like the word, “surpass” and has a meaning that aligns well with the mission of the Association. The council voted by majority on September 25, 2013, to adopt the acronym SURPAS.\n\n\nRevision History (current version approved: January 2023)\n\nSection 1: 1998-1999 Session\n\nCreation\n1,200 Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford\n\n–\n\n\nSection 2: 2010 Session\n\nUnknown\n1,800 Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford\n\n–\n\n\nSection 3: 2013 Session\n\nRedesign of Bylaws based on Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) Bylaws\nCreation of Advisory Board\nAdded articles for Conflict of Interest, Conflict Resolution, non-discrimination, decision making\nRemoved redundant passages\n2,000 Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford\n\n–\n\n\nSection 4: 2015 Session\n\nAdded activity requirement for Council members to contribute to SURPAS that will be evaluated during review prior to re-election after one year\n\n–\n\n\nSection 5: 2016 Session\n\nChange in the election timing of co-chairs, leadership team and honorary committees\nAdded a responsibility for secretary\nAdded a clause on maternity leave\n\n–\n\n\nSection 6: 2017 Session\n\nAdded positions of Events Coordinator and Advocacy Coordinator to leadership team\nUpdated bylaws to reflect organizational practices (including cap on council seats, number of meetings held, SPIF budget, committee formation, officer responsibilities, timing of elections)\nIncluded diversity and inclusion statement in mission\nExpanded maternity leave clause to include other types of leave\nAdded guidelines for external communications\n2,100 Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford\n\n–\n\n\nSection 7: 2018 & 2019 Sessions\nDocumentation of previously-approved updates\n\nUse of poll everywhere for voting\nNov and Dec meetings may occur earlier than the last week of month\nCouncil meetings can occur in different locations across campus\nSURPAS seats on ‘honorary committees’\nUpdated structure and responsibilities for SURPAS Leadership\nUpdated timing of elections to reflect offset co-chair positions and campaign regulations.\nTerm information for Council and Leadership members\n\nMinor updates to bylaw language\n\nCouncil member responsibilities include the ability to override decisions by the leadership team and require active participation in SURPAS activities\nCouncil member term expiration includes notice\nDefined ‘adequate’ notification for meetings.\nUpdated the process for the management of Committees and information stream from Committees to the Leadership and Council\nRecognition of other postdoc groups on campus\n\nCategory 3 - Major updates to bylaw content\n\nVotes of no confidence for removal from positions.\nUpdated the process for the appointment and responsibilities of Committee chairs.\nAdded new Community Engagement Liaison position\n\n–\n\n\nSection 8: 2020 Session\nApproved changes\n\nPostdocs transitioning to non-tenure track roles may continue to be SURPAS members and occupy voting council member seats as long as there are open Council seats and no new members wishing to occupy these.\nWording to increase accessibility to SURPAS Council Meetings\nChanges to guidelines for using SURPAS emails\n\nMinor updates to bylaw language\n\n“Maternal/baby/bonding leave” changed to “parental/baby bonding leave”\n2400 postdocs at Stanford\n\n–\n\n\nSection 9: 2021-2022 Session\n\nSURPAS co-chairs should extend an invitation and share OPA meeting agenda to the affinity groups. This will enhance SURPAS collaborative interaction with the postdoc affinity groups.\nThe position of SURPAS representative to the School of Medicine Diversity Cabinet is an elected position from within the current SURPAS leadership OR The position of SURPAS representative to the School of Medicine Diversity Cabinet is an elected position from within the SURPAS Council OR The position of SURPAS representative to the School of Medicine Diversity Cabinet will be assumed by the Advocacy Coordinator.\nSURPAS co-chairs should invite Faculty Staff Help Center to present at Council Meetings biannually – this is essential as postdocs are a transient community within Stanford and ensuring that all incoming postdocs have the opportunity to know about the services that FSHC provide is important. Postdocs face many challenges both in research, mentor-mentee relationships and personally and it is important to ensure that our community is aware of these services.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 10: 2022-2023 Session\n\nAddition to Treasurer/Financial Officer’s responsibility: All monthly financial transactions shall be completed within SURPAS for each month prior to the 1st of the next month.\nAddition to Co-Chairs’ responsibility: Add “Co-Chairs should schedule quarterly meetings with OPA and Affinity group co-chairs”.\nCouncil member responsibility: Council members must attend at least 9 (75%) council meetings in a year of service on council. Excused absences should be coordinated with the Operations Manager in advance of the meeting. Excused absences and canceled meetings will not be considered missed meetings. Council members missing 3 (25%) scheduled council meetings will be given a warning. Missing additional meetings thereafter will result in being removed from the roster and losing membership.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle I: General\n\nSection 1: Mission\n\nThe mission of the Stanford University Postdoctoral Association is to enrich the Postdoctoral experience at Stanford, to enable Postdoctoral Scholars to explore opportunities, and to empower Postdoctoral Scholars to become leaders in areas of their choice.\nThe Council represents and advocates for the best interests of all Stanford Postdoctoral Scholars. Primary goals of the Council include the following:\n\nTo develop social and networking opportunities for Postdoctoral Scholars from all disciplines, in the interest of fostering a community of postdocs at Stanford.\nTo promote inclusion and representation of all postdoctoral fellows and advocate for a postdoctoral community that better reflects the diversity that is crucial for research and other progress.\nTo work with University Administration to optimize the postdoctoral experience.\nTo strive for the professional enrichment and development of Postdoctoral Scholars.\nTo ensure that postdoctoral benefits and salaries are commensurate with the NIH salary scale and the high cost of living in the Bay Area.\nTo clearly define and communicate the Postdoctoral Scholar status at an institutional level.\n\nThe members of the Council will act as a liaison to the postdoctoral population at large and represent the interests of Postdoctoral Scholars to the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs and to Stanford University by representing Postdoctoral Scholars on University committees and governing bodies.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 2: Membership of Registered Postdoctoral Scholars\nAll registered Postdoctoral Scholars of Stanford University are members of SURPAS. Registered Postdoctoral Scholars of Stanford University shall be defined to include all Postdoctoral Scholars appointed by the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs of Stanford University. SURPAS recognizes that there are people working in similar positions [individuals who possess a doctoral degree (Ph.D., M.D., J.D., Ed.D., etc.) and conduct research under a Stanford faculty member’s sponsorship or supervision, but are not appointed by the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (such as Research Associates and Visiting Scholars)]. These individuals are not members of SURPAS, but are invited to participate in SURPAS events. SURPAS recognizes that Postdoctoral scholars may move into other non-tenure track trainee roles at Stanford upon expiration of the Postdoctoral scholar term limit or award of transitional funding. These former Postdocs may continue to be SURPAS members.\n–\n\n\nSection 3: Dissolution of the Organization.\nSURPAS will be dissolved when its mission is accomplished.\n–\n\n\nSection 4: Non-Discrimination and Diversity Statement\nThese Bylaws, the Council, the elected officers, and all Committees, shall not discriminate against any individual or organization on account of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability. SURPAS seeks to promote diversity and ensure equal opportunity and inclusion for all Postdoctoral Scholars, across all seven schools, in the membership, leadership, and activities of SURPAS.\n–\n\n\nSection 5: Conflict of Interest\n\nThe members of the Leadership Team, Council, and Committees are expected to avoid any actual or apparent conflict between their own individual personal or professional interests and the interests of SURPAS. The members of the Leadership Team, Council, and Committees shall act at all times in the best interests of SURPAS. This means setting aside personal self-interest and performing their duties in transaction of the affairs of SURPAS in such a manner that promotes confidence and trust in the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of the Leadership Team, the Council, and Committees.\nThis Conflict of Interest policy is in place to protect both the individual and SURPAS from accusations of improper conduct. As such, all members of the Leadership Team, the Council, and Committees are expected to respect the Conflict of Interest policy and should feel personal responsibility for self-monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle II: Legislative Branch\n\nSection 1: Members of the Council\n\nSURPAS Council shall be composed of thirty (30) total seats.\nAll members of SURPAS are eligible to run for vacant Council seats. Former Postdocs who have moved into non-tenure track roles may continue to serve on SURPAS Council.\nIf the Council has more volunteers than open slots, new members will be recruited by elections with consideration given to the current needs of the Council.\nIf all Council member slots become full, Council slots occupied by former Postdocs now in early career, non-tenure track roles must move into advisory roles to make Council seats available for new members.\nThe membership of the Council is to be representative of the Postdoctoral Scholar distribution across the seven schools at Stanford. This will be achieved to the extent possible, by active recruitment by current council members and the leadership team.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 2: Responsibilities\n\nThe Council holds the overall responsibility for SURPAS’ operations with guidance from, the Leadership Team (Article III, Section 1), its Advisory Board (Article VII, Section 2), and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Council members have the right to openly discuss decisions made by the Leadership Team and request a motion to override such decisions with a simple majority vote.\nCouncil members must attend at least 9 (75%) council meetings in a year of service on council. Excused absences should be coordinated with the Operations Manager in advance of the meeting. Excused absences and canceled meetings will not be considered missed meetings. Council members missing 3 (25%) scheduled council meetings will be given a warning. Missing additional meetings thereafter will result in being removed from the roster and losing membership.\nIn addition to attending council meetings, council members must significantly contribute to SURPAS activities and the well-being of postdocs at Stanford. For example, council members are required to either (a) serve on the leadership team (Article III), (b) serve as a Faculty Senate representative (Section 7), (c) be an active member of a SURPAS Committee (Sections 5 & 6) or (d) be an active member of a postdoc affinity group. The council will review each member’s contribution to SURPAS and the well-being of postdocs at Stanford at the end of their one year term and can then vote on re-election to the SURPAS council.\nCouncil members must ensure that pertinent information is disseminated to the postdoctoral population at large. They will communicate concerns to the Council from those Postdoctoral Scholars that they represent, and hold informal meetings with Postdoctoral Scholars as necessary.\nCouncil members must inform Postdoctoral Scholars of special events and help organize as needed.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 3: Term Expiration\n\nAppointments to the Council are for one year, confirmed by a letter of appointment or email.\nMembers who are no longer able to execute their tasks shall notify the Co-Chairs in writing.\nIf a member fails to attend 3 meetings in a row, without prior notification to the Operations Manager, he or she will be notified in writing by the Co-Chairs that they are no longer an active member of the Council.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 4: Meetings of the Council\n\nThe Co-Chairs and the Leadership Team may call meetings of the Council.

Council members can abstain from voting. Votes that concern missions, plans, and other impersonal items can be done by a show of hands, as the Council sees fit.\nThe Co-Chairs shall share responsibility of the Presiding Officer at each Council meeting.\nCouncil meetings shall be scheduled the last week of each month, with the exception of November and December which may occur earlier in the month due to holidays. Additional Council meetings can be called, as the need arises. The Council shall be given adequate notice of planned meetings.\nCouncil meetings shall take place throughout campus and/or on zoom to ease accessibility and improve participation from postdocs across all Stanford schools and departments.\n\nSURPAS Leadership members must actively be mindful of accessibility when scheduling Council meetings. This includes scheduling Council meetings in rooms that meet ADA requirements and which are located throughout campus, and/or via a web based platform (such as Zoom)\nAll SURPAS members are invited to attend meetings, but are eligible to vote only when they are members of the Council.\nCouncil meetings last no longer than 1.5 hours.

The Council can also decide to allocate a budget upon installment of a Committee, pending approval by the Treasurer/Financial Officer.\nAll Committees shall regularly report to the Leadership Team, and, if suitable to the Council, at a Council meeting through the Chair (or Co-Chairs) or Committee Representative. The Committee Chair (or Co-Chairs) must submit a Project Plan outlining the Committee’s goals and activities for the year to the Leadership Team each January. Status reports from Committees may also be requested on an ad hoc basis by any Council member. If a Committee Chair or Representative is not a member of council, they will still be regulated under the same attendance requirements as Council members (Article II Section 2).\nA Committee will go out of existence when its goals have been met or task is complete, or can be terminated or merged with another Committee by majority vote of the Council.\nCommittees of structural importance or that serve essential roles to postdoc well-being at Stanford will become standing committees with their own guidelines.\nAny SURPAS member may propose a Committee to the Co-Chairs, Leadership, or Council. The Council will then discuss and vote on the formation of the Committee at the next meeting. Committees can be created by the Leadership without a vote of the Council (Article III Section 1D).\n\n–\n\n\nSection 6: Standing Committees - SURPAS Postdoc Initiative Fund (SPIF)\n\nObjectives and mandate of SPIF: to provide financial support and foster Postdoctoral Scholar initiatives that enrich the postdoctoral experience at Stanford. SPIF will consider a broad range of projects, and funding is targeted towards groups mostly specific to Postdoctoral Scholar affairs. Postdoctoral Scholars must be significantly involved in the organization of acceptable initiatives. In principle, any group can be considered for funding if the projects are organized mainly by and for Postdoctoral Scholars.\nThe rules of operation are described in the general guidelines of SPIF.\nThe chair of SPIF regularly reports to the Treasurer/Financial Officer about approved proposals, and the amount of funding that is awarded, and monthly to the Council about their progress.\nThe annual operating budget of SPIF shall be set and agreed upon by the Council as part of the Treasurer’s/Financial Officer’s budget proposal for the upcoming year (Article III Section 5B).\n\n–\n\n\nSection 7: Postdoc Representative Seats\n\nSURPAS has a voting seat on the Faculty Senate Committee on Library (C-LIB), Faculty Senate Committee on Academic Computing and Information Systems (C-ACIS), and Faculty Senate Committee on Research (C-RES). These prestigious seats must be filled by May-June to be effective by September of the same year and are elected by Council.\nThe Co-Chairs are granted two non-voting seats on the Faculty Senate for the School of Medicine, but in the instance that one or both Co-Chairs do not come from the School of Medicine another SURPAS member may be appointed (at least one of the two seats should be occupied by a member of the Leadership Team).\nSURPAS has one voting seat on the School of Medicine Diversity Cabinet that can be filled by appointment of a member of the Council or the Leadership Team.\nThe Co-Chairs are granted one non-voting seat on the University Faculty Senate.\nThe Co-Chairs have two non-voting seats on the Provost Advisory Council on Postdoctoral Affairs (PACPA).\nSURPAS representatives to these Committees, Cabinets, and Senates will uphold these Bylaws and represent to their best ability the interests of the Council and all Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford.

All members shall provide their feedback, and the final version shall be voted during the next meeting.\nMeetings can take place in person or via web-based communication platforms (Eg: Skype/zoom) and can be rescheduled when multiple Committee members indicate in advance that they cannot attend. It is recommended that Committees meet in preparation of Council meetings.\n\nDecisions taken at Committee meetings are based on consensus and must be supported by all active members present.\n\nIf opposing views exist the Committee is advised to defer the decision and look for a solution backed by all.\nIf no resolution can be reached among members, committees can appeal to SURPAS Council or Leadership for advice and resolution.\n\nDecisions are preferably taken during face-to-face meetings, either in person or via a web-based communication platform (Skype, Webex, Zoom, etc.).\n\nIf rapid action is required and a face-to-face meeting is not possible, the responsible member shall notify each member prior to action.\nCommittee members may vote per email, with regards to Committee decisions.\nCommittee members may vote per web tool, with regards to Committee decisions.\nAll active Committee members have one vote each.\nCommittee members cannot vote on behalf of absent members.\n\nCommittees may defer the rules stated in Article IV Section 1B and Article IV Section 1C in extreme cases, such as prolonged leave of absence (Article II, Section 9). Should this occur, outward communication will state that the decision was not unanimous, the minutes will explain the extraordinary situation, and the reason shall be shared with all active Committee members. Moreover an active solution must be sought (Article IV Section 1B2).\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle V: Elections\n\nSection 1: General\n\nSURPAS holds Council and Officer elections.\nCouncil elections shall occur when there are vacant Council seats. Officer elections shall occur in January for one of the two Co-Chair positions and the Community Engagement Liaison and June/July for the other Co-Chair position and rest of the Leadership Team. The positions will be effective by February or August of the same year depending on when the election occurred. All elections shall be held during a regular Council meeting.\nIn the case that an officer position becomes vacant mid-term, elections for that position shall be called within one month to create an interim officer.\nThe positions shall be advertised to all SURPAS members and then selected by majority vote of the Council at an advertised Council meeting. All posts will be held for one year. Council members and officers may run for consecutive terms.\nThe Co-Chairs shall present the election results to the Council, SURPAS, and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 2: Campaign Regulations\n\nPostdoctoral Scholars who are interested in running for a Council position shall notify the Co-Chairs or the Operations Manager.\nEligible Postdoctoral Scholars shall have attended at least one prior Council meetings.\nCouncil members interested in running for an officer position shall notify the Co-Chairs or the Operations Manager.\nCandidates shall submit a written statement to the Co-Chairs so that it can be shared with the Council members and Leadership Team prior to voting.\nThe Co-Chairs shall share the names of candidates with the Council prior to elections.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 3: Voting\n\nVoting shall occur only at Council meetings, where each Council member present shall carry one vote. Results depend on a majority and the rules of quorum.\nIn the case of a tie, elections are adjourned and the Council shall call for runoff elections.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 4: Invalidation of Election Results\nThe Council shall have power to invalidate the results of an election if the election was not done in accordance with the Bylaws.\n\n\n\n\nArticle VI: Finances\n\nSection 1: General\n\nThe Treasurer/Financial Officer shall maintain all financial records and distribute the budget proposal and budget among the Leadership Team and the Council (Article III Section 6B).\nAny Council member may request insight into financial documentation by approaching the Co-Chairs or Treasurer/Financial Officer.\nThe fiscal year of SURPAS shall begin on July 1 and end on June 30.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 2: SURPAS Operating Budget\n\nNo funds shall be expended, encumbered, or otherwise disbursed by SURPAS other than in accordance with the procedures for the authorization of expenditures or investments contained in these Bylaws.\nAll funds expended by SURPAS shall be used for the basic operating expenses of SURPAS, or for programs initiated by and under the control of SURPAS and its agencies (including SPIF and requests from the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs).\nNo funds shall be expended as salaries or wages by any SURPAS member, department or agency.\nThe allocated SURPAS budget may be deposited in an account with the Capitol Group banking services of the Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE), a division of the ASSU or with SURPAS’ PTA, under the authority of the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs.\nThe Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs will serve to oversee the accounts and holds authority to close them in case of financial malfeasance or non-compliance on the part of the Leadership Team or Council. The Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs will facilitate any necessary mediation of disputes or problems regarding this account.\nEvents and activities charged to the SURPAS accounts must comply with University Event Planning and Alcohol Policies as well as other applicable funding policies that pertain to student groups at Stanford, including those on sponsorships, unless a written authorization for a policy exception is received by the Treasurer/Financial Officer from the Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs.\nAt the end of the funding period (annually), unspent funds in the account may be carried forward to the next fiscal period upon discussion and approval of the following year’s budget proposal with the Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs, with the exception of funds designated to sponsor major events, which must be returned to the sponsors if unspent.\nAny funds specifically deposited in one funding period (e.g., University fiscal year) for an event in a later funding period (e.g., the subsequent University fiscal year) may be automatically rolled-over. The Treasurer/Financial Officer will confirm the roll-over ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle VII: Review and Conflict Resolution\n\nSection 1: Conflict Resolution\n\nIt is the policy of SURPAS to provide Postdoctoral Scholars with an opportunity to resolve disputes in a fair and collegial manner. These guidelines establish a formal process for SURPAS members, including council members and officers, to request, review and redress certain disputes arising out of their relationships within SURPAS. This section does not deal with conflict between Postdoctoral Scholars and their PIs or colleagues.\nConflicts that cannot be resolved at local level should be brought to the attention of the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs will listen to the complaints and hear everyone involved. They should attempt to achieve a satisfactory solution by referring to these Bylaws. The Co-Chairs may seek advice from the Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs.\nFor disagreements that remain unresolved after the Co-Chairs are consulted, a grievance process will be initiated when the SURPAS member files a written grievance with the Co-Chairs. The parties in the grievance process shall be the person(s) filing the grievance and the person(s) responsible for the act or omission that gave rise to the grievance.\nIn response to the written grievance, the Co-Chairs will seek advice from the Advisory Board. Should the dispute involve the Co-Chairs, Council members may approach the Advisory Board directly.\nThe advice from the Advisory Board will be communicated to the Council¸ which will formally decide how to implement the advice.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 2: Advisory Board\n\nThe purpose of the Advisory Board is to provide advice to the Co-Chairs and Council and thereby help them navigate through unforeseen situations which are not adequately covered by these Bylaws.\nMembership & Member Qualifications:\n\nThe Advisory Board shall consist of three members, ideally:\n\nThe Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs\nThe Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs (School of Medicine)\nThe Vice Provost for Graduate Education.\n\nMembership shall be recruited from Stanford staff and faculty, who are impartial to Postdoctoral Scholars.\nThe Co-Chairs of the Council organize the invitations to serve on the Advisory Board if they cannot be filled from the three positions listed above. Nominations will be discussed with and approved by the Council.\nAdvisory Board members agree to serve for two years, open to renewal.\nAdvisory Board membership is a volunteer role without compensation.\nAdvisory board members shall notify the Co-Chairs when they are no longer able to execute their functions, whereupon the Co-Chairs shall seek replacements.\nAdvisory Board members shall have experience with postdoctoral affairs, conflict resolution, or rules of conduct.\n\nOperation:\n\nThe Co-Chairs of the Council will approach the Advisory Board with a written statement of grievance filed by the complainant, as well as a written account of attempts at reconciliation. The Board shall review the conflict and issue advice on future actions. Review may include meeting with the Postdoctoral Scholars involved, or soliciting feedback. The advice shall be two-fold:\n\nAdvice aimed at helping the Council resolve the current conflict.\nAdvice aimed at preventing similar grievance from occurring again.\n\nThe Advisory Board is free to decide its mode of operation, but will communicate a timeline to the Co-Chairs upon receipt of the request.\nThe Co-Chairs will provide an annual update of affairs to the Advisory Board. SURPAS Bylaws 16\n\n\n–\n\n\nSection 3: The Untimely Removal of an Appointed Officer\n\nFor the purpose of this guideline, an “appointed officer” shall be taken to mean any position whose occupant must be approved by the Council.\nAppointed Officers can be removed by the Council for failure to execute their responsibilities. Any individual or Committee subject to possible disciplinary action by the Council must be given written notice of the intended action at least 72 hours before the meeting at which the disciplinary action would be approved, so that they are allowed to speak in defense at the meeting. The council will vote by 2/3 majority.\n\n–\n\n\nSection 4: Review\n\nThe Council shall review these Bylaws annually in December and/or January (or as needed) under direction of the Operations Manager (Article III Section 6E) and Leadership Team or as an ad hoc committee.\nThe portion of the SURPAS policies that affect the Council may be adopted, amended, or repealed by a 2/3 vote of the Council. Association policies not affecting the Council may be adopted, amended, or repealed by a majority vote of the Council, provided that consultation with the governing body of the affected SURPAS entity has occurred.\nProposed changes to these Bylaws can be made at any time following discussion at a regularly scheduled Council meeting, and should be submitted in writing to the Co-Chairs and presented for discussion at the next scheduled Council meeting.\nProposed changes must be submitted to the Council at least two weeks in advance to the Council meeting at which the vote shall occur, to allow for ample time for review.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle VIII: External Communications\n\nSection 1: Announcements on behalf of Council\nIn the event that a council member(s) wishes to make a statement on behalf of the Council, the member(s) should present the written statement to the Leadership Team. If the Leadership Team reaches consensus that the statement reflects the spirit and/or goals of the Council, they will share the statement with the Council prior to the next meeting. Council will then vote to approve the release of the statement to the Postdoctoral community, passed by simple majority. If the statement requires expedience (cannot or should not wait until the next Council meeting), the Leadership may distribute the statement to the Council electronically with a deadline of at least 24 hours for approval. The statement may be released once a majority of Council members approve.\n–\n\n\nSection 2: Communication with the Media\nIn the event that a Council member(s) are contacted by a member(s) of the media external to the University (journalists, bloggers, etc…) to solicit opinions, it is highly recommended that the member consult with the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs and/or the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education about how to respond. Stanford does not set limitations for interactions with the media. However, Council members are advised to think carefully about the experiences they can speak to and to critically interrogate the motivations of those seeking comment. Any statement made must clearly be the opinion of the individual Council member(s) and not as Council or SURPAS or the Stanford postdoctoral community as a whole without prior approval and consent (as outlined in Article VIII Section 1).\n–\n\n\nSection 3: Interactions with other Postdoc Groups\nThe Office of Student Engagement (OSE) at Stanford University recognizes SURPAS as the only official postdoctoral organization; however, SURPAS recognizes and works with any other group whose goal is to represent the diverse identities and interests of postdoctoral scholars at Stanford.\n–\n\n\nSection 4: Communications during the Fall and Winter Holidays\nThanksgiving is a national holiday that is celebrated widely, most times without thought about the historical context. SURPAS, however, should be thoughtful about what Thanksgiving means both for Indigenous people and traditional family gatherings when messaging around this time. This could be an important opportunity for education about colonial violence and the centering of Indigenous heritage and sovereignty. Similarly, Winter brings a variety of holidays, each unique to their religion of origin and each celebrated by some and not others. Messaging around the Winter Holidays should be done with this in mind.\n\n\n\nAppendices\nLeadership Guide(s) Events Planning Guide\nImportant University Contacts"

    "text": "This section of the Report contains recommendations to address the issues identified throughout the previous sections. For each identified issue, specific recommendations are provided for various stakeholder groups. These recommendations call on the stakeholder groups to continue, to change, or to begin a course of action. These recommendations aim to suggest specific policies and actions that comport with the general principles outlined in the Executive Summary. Even as specific policies are implemented, these principles can continue to guide advocacy for postdocs looking to be recognized as full and valued members of the academic research enterprise. These principles include:\n\nPostdocs should be appreciated and not exploited.\nPostdocs’ basic needs should be met.\nPostdocs should have job security.\nPostdocs should receive job structure and career support outside of their immediate research groups.\nPostdocs should be actively included in University business.\n\nThe first stakeholder group for each issue is postdocs themselves as individuals. Recommendations are informed by the lived experience of Committee members and the general postdoctoral population in recognition of the agency postdocs possess in taking direct action to improve their material conditions. The next recommendations are directed at SURPAS (i.e. postdocs working together collectively) and are a crystallization of institutional knowledge from long-serving postdoc organizers. Though most recommendations for postdocs collectively are targeted towards SURPAS specifically, postdocs can and do organize collectively in other ways (e.g. affinity groups); these organized postdocs can take advantage of these recommendations as well.\nThe next stakeholder group is Stanford Faculty, highlighting expectations postdocs have of their senior colleagues. The next stakeholder is the Stanford Administration, indicating what is expected of those with decision making power within the university structure. Stanford Administration exists at multiple different levels, ranging from university-wide (Provost level) to local (Department level) and in between (School level) and can have overlap with faculty who fill some administrative positions. We have suggested recommendations directed towards Stanford Admin in general but these may be best implemented at differing levels within that stakeholder group; the Committee leaves specifics of implementation to those who will perform that work.\nFunding bodies (e.g. NIH, NSF, private funders) are included as the next stakeholder group to indicate postdoc perspectives on incentive structures within academic research. Publishing and professional organizations (e.g. journals, preprint servers, professional societies [e.g. National Postdoc Association, Biophysical Society]) are included as the next stakeholder group. Local community members, such as Stanford undergraduates, graduate students, or other non-postdoc groups in Stanford and the Bay Area, are included as the next stakeholder group to provide seeds for future collaboration. Local government is included as the next stakeholder, generally represented by the Board of Supervisors for Santa Clara County since Stanford sits on unincorporated county land. State and national governments represent the final stakeholder."

    "section": "Costs: Overall",
    "text": "Costs: Overall\nIdentified Issue:\nMany postdocs at Stanford struggle with covering basic needs for themselves and their families. While Stanford pays more than the NIH’s national minimum salary, the cost of living around Stanford is incredibly high and postdocs continue to struggle to meet necessary costs. Effectively addressing this critical issue would relieve postdocs of the enormous mental toll of financial precarity and allow them to focus on doing their best work.\nRecommendations:\n\nPostdocs themselves (as individuals) should:\n\napply for supplemental grants provided by Stanford that can help cover some living expenses (e.g. the Family Grant, Childcare Grant, Backup childcare, and Emergency grant-in-aid).\ncontinue to advocate for themselves to their faculty advisors, their department, and school for increases in salary.\n\nSURPAS (postdocs collectively) should:\n\ncontinue to advocate for increases to the Postdoc Minimum Salary.\nreach out to and build solidarity with other academic postdocs in the Bay Area. (Postdocs at the University of California went on strike with their union at the end of 2022. SURPAS should invite the UC Postdoc Union to present at a SURPAS Council meeting.)\ncreate a Postdoc Salary Committee to uncover data on local cost of living, postdoc salaries at peer institutions, and investigate other useful comparisons to generate well-justified and heavily evidence-based proposals for Stanford Postdoc Salaries, in support of the advocacy efforts of the SURPAS Co-Chairs.\ncontinue to request aggregated salary data for the postdoc population from the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs.\ncontinue regularly surveying postdocs in order to collect information about their salary level and cost of living pressures.\nmaintain a historical record of the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary (and related details) and the Area Median Income for Santa Clara County, to be used in future salary negotiations. (Refer to Data Tables in Appendix D.)\n\nStanford Faculty should:\n\npay their own postdocs more.\nadvocate for postdoc salary increases within their own department and school and across the University at large.\ninclude budget requests for postdoc salaries that reflect the cost of living in the Bay Area in grant applications.\n\nStanford Admin should:\n\nraise the Postdoc Minimum Salary to restore local area purchasing power for postdocs to pre-2019 levels. For the 2022-23 academic year, this would be $82,000.\nraise the postdoc salary to at least the Low Income level (Low Income is defined by the federal government’s Department of Housing and Urban Development as 80% of Area Median Income, which for Santa Clara County in 2022 was $92,250) in Santa Clara County for a one-person household so a single postdoc supporting themselves is not required to live in poverty.\nincrease postdoc salary for each additional year of experience (for instance, by +3.5% per year), as is done by the NIH (i.e. have a graded salary scale for postdocs).\nmake aggregated postdoc salary data available and transparent on a yearly basis, so that all postdocs at Stanford have a clear understanding of where their own salary fits within the distribution of postdoc salaries at Stanford.\nleverage Stanford’s Buffer funds in order to help cover Minimum Postdoc Salaries, for example to offset shortfalls in faculty-obtained grants from funding agencies.\nundertake targeted fundraising and create an endowed fund that covers the gap between NIH Minimum Salary and the Low Income level in Santa Clara County ($92,250 in 2022) for postdoc salaries so that faculty can afford to hire postdocs.\n\nFunding Bodies should:\n\nincrease their mandated Minimum Postdoc Salary to account for the existing advanced training and expected research contributions of postdocs.\nnormalize their minimum funding levels to account for the cost of living where postdocs work.\nprovide increased funds for senior postdoctoral fellows and research scientists.\n\nPublishing and Professional Organizations should:\n\nhighlight the lived reality of material conditions for postdocs and advocate for increased salaries.\n\nLocal Community should:\n\n(Bay Area postdoc associations) collaborate with postdocs at Stanford to advocate collectively for better compensation and conditions for all postdocs, particularly given the high cost of living in the Bay Area.\n\nSanta Clara County Board of Supervisors should:\n\nensure postdocs are included in any studies about workers at Stanford as a specific stakeholder group.\n\nState and National Governments should:\n\nallocate funds to support increased salaries for researchers.\ncreate policies to forgive student loans up to a certain dollar amount for every year of work as a postdoc for all postdocs."

    "text": "Costs: Food Insecurity\nIdentified Issue:\nPostdocs at Stanford suffer from food insecurity and the number has been rising in recent years. In Fall 2019, nearly 10% of postdocs suffered from food insecurity. During the COVID-19 pandemic and before the historic inflation of 2022, that number increased to 36% of postdocs suffering from food insecurity. At the January 2023 SURPAS Council meeting, postdocs were informed they were no longer eligible to utilize the pop-up food pantry created in 2020 (though the service would not turn anyone away).\nRecommendations:\n\nPostdocs themselves (as individuals) should:\n\ncontinue to avail themselves of the monthly pop-up food pantry as needed to combat food insecurity.\nsupport each other, for instance through mutual aid efforts.\n\nSURPAS (postdocs collectively) should:\n\ncontinue to advertise and send information about the monthly pop-up food pantry to the postdoc population.\ncontinue to advocate for the Postdoc Minimum Salary to be increased.\ncontinue to ask postdocs in regular surveys about their experience of food insecurity.\ncontinue to provide food at all SURPAS-hosted events at no cost to attendees.\nform coalitions with other organized groups on campus (undergraduates, graduates, workers) to collectively address this issue.\n\nStanford Faculty should:\n\npay their postdocs more.\nsuggest and promote opportunities for providing postdocs with meals, for instance in one-on-one meetings or lab meetings.\n\nseek departmental and/or school financial support in order to take your postdoc/s to lunch (as has been done during National Postdoc Appreciation Week in the past).\nadvertise the existence of the pop-up food pantry to incoming postdocs when they are hired to help new postdocs meet their basic needs.\nproactively ask their employees about whether they are able to cover their own basic needs and those of their family on their current salary, and increase their salary accordingly.\n\nStanford Admin should:\n\nincrease the Postdoc Minimum Salary so that in the future no postdocs and their families suffer from food insecurity. Ensure basic needs can be met for postdocs with their salaries in the high cost of living Bay Area.\noffer subsidized meal plan services for postdocs on campus.\nat the departmental and school level, provide financial support for faculty to provide food for postdocs, for instance in one-on-one meetings or lab meetings.\nat the departmental and school level, provide financial support for faculty to take their postdoc/s to lunch (as has been done during National Postdoc Appreciation Week in the past).\npublish data on monthly utilization of the pop-up food pantry.\nask about food insecurity on University-wide surveys, and make the data and results from these surveys publicly available.\n\nFunding Bodies should:\n\nincrease mandated minimum postdoc salaries and normalize these to the cost of living in the location of the institution.\npenalize institutions that allow postdocs and other trainees to suffer from food insecurity (e.g. by lowering the Facilities and Administrative rate for delinquent universities).\nprovide funding for researchers to study food insecurity within the academic workforce.\n\nPublishing and Professional Organizations should:\n\ncontinue to highlight the difficulties faced by postdocs, including meeting their basic needs, in publications.\ncontinue to provide subsidized membership and registration fees to postdocs.\n\nLocal Community should:\n\n(Second Harvest Food Bank) evaluate their income limits for access to food banks in light of the historic inflation that occurred in 2022.\n(Organized groups on campus) form coalitions with postdoc groups to collectively address this issue.\n\nSanta Clara County Board of Supervisors should:\n\nfund a study to determine the degree of food insecurity for postdocs and all other workers employed by Stanford to determine the drain on county resources due to low compensation for Stanford workers.\n\nState and National Governments should:\n\nincrease funding for academic research.\nenact policies to eliminate food insecurity and ensure basic needs are met for all residents."

    "text": "Building Community\nIdentified Issue:\nBuilding community within the postdoc population and within other local (and non-local) communities is essential for making friends, improving mental health, developing innovative collaborations and work satisfaction. Unfortunately, postdocs face more challenges to building community than other groups on campus as a result of working (often) solely within independent research groups that may or may not have any other postdocs in them, not being a part of any timed-entry cohort group (as graduate are, for instance), and have a great deal of pressure (internal or external) on them to work hard and perform at their best. These factors mean that structures to promote the building of community are even more important for postdocs.\nRecommendations:\n\nPostdocs themselves (as individuals) should:\n\nproactively participate in events within their lab, department, school, and across the University, especially postdoc organized events. In addition to forming community with postdocs, these other venues give postdocs the opportunity to integrate more effectively into the university-wide community.\ncontinue to form community groups based on mutual interests.

Initial pilots for the Postdoc Wine Appreciation Club and Postdoc Reading Open Social Event (PROSE) Book Club were supported by SPIF.\n\nSURPAS (postdocs collectively) should:\n\ncontinue to hold social events to build community. These types of events include happy hours run by the full Council and activities planned by various SURPAS committees such as the Family Committee Fall Festival or different organized activities coordinated by the Sports Committee.\ncontinue to support the work of the postdoc affinity groups (Stanford Black Postdoc Association [SBPA], Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association [SLPA], Stanford LGBTQIA+ Postdocs, Stanford Chinese Postdocs) in building community.\ncontinue to offer small grants to postdocs for building community and enriching the postdoc experience via the Stanford Postdoctoral Initiative Fund (SPIF) program.8 This is required by Article II, Section 6 of the SURPAS By-Laws.\nset up a ‘buddy system’ pairing newly arriving postdocs together in small groups to create a postdoc cohort. These groups can and should include some older postdoc volunteers who can help share knowledge and resources to the new cohorts.\nactively invite postdocs who have transitioned into staff roles to join postdoc community events.\nactively invite postdocs who are officially classified as Visiting Scholars to join postdoc community events.\nadvocate for the creation of an endowed fund to cover the yearly SURPAS operating budget.\nexplore strategies to develop an independent funding source, potentially following models from ASSU, which has been financially independent from the University since 1995,9 or The Stanford Daily, which has been independent of the University since 1973.10\n\nStanford Faculty should:\n\nproactively make sure postdocs are included in community building events at the lab, department, school, and university levels.\nensure postdocs have a place to celebrate the American holiday Thanksgiving, for instance by inviting lab members to their home.\n\nStanford Admin should:\n\ndesignate a community space for postdocs.\nempower postdocs to more easily book rooms on campus.\nformally recognize postdoc affinity groups.\nperform targeted fundraising to create an endowed fund to provide the SURPAS operating budget. Funding for SURPAS is contingent upon distribution from OPA and VPGEPA, and has not had increases that meet inflation. Occasionally, administrators threaten SURPAS with removal of funding if the organization pursues certain avenues of advocacy. An endowed fund would provide long-term stability and independence to SURPAS.\n\nFunding Bodies should:\n\ncreate grants that postdocs and other trainees can apply for to receive funding to build community, especially for marginalized groups underrepresented in academia.\n\nPublishing and Professional Organizations should:\n\nhighlight stories of successful examples of community building by postdocs and other trainees to showcase models that can be adapted to other institutions.\n\nLocal Community should:\n\n(existing community centers on campus) include postdocs in outreach for community building and cultural events.\n\nSanta Clara County Board of Supervisors should:\n\ncoordinate with the SURPAS Community Engagement Liaison to invite postdocs to community events.\n\nState and National Governments should:\n\ntrack and disclose on a publicly accessible dashboard statistics about postdocs (e.g. number, compensation, place of employment) working within their borders."

This document should be shared online.\nhave a follow-up orientation presentation other than the first on-boarding meeting (which has more information than one can absorb at the time).\nassist in administering the cohort/buddy system to connect postdocs with each other.\n\nFunding Bodies should:\n\nrequire an on-boarding plan for incoming postdocs as part of the training plan in fellowship applications.\n\nPublishing and Professional Organizations should:\n\n(professional organizations) hold quarterly webinars with general information for incoming postdocs based on the location of the organization.\n\nLocal Community should:\n\n(Undergraduates and Graduate students) share relevant and helpful information to new Postdocs arriving in their lab.\n\nSanta Clara County Board of Supervisors should:\n\ndirect the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to send quarterly ‘Know Your Rights’ information to postdocs at Stanford.\n\nState and National Governments should:\n\n(State) work with local Universities to set up a state-specific guideline for incoming Postdocs that can be adopted by individual Universities.\n(National) work with the National Postdoc Association and Universities to set-up a general guideline for incoming postdocs."

Postdocs may work long or unusual hours and therefore need to be on and moving around campus late at night; Black postdocs may be asked by campus police (Stanford Department of Public Safety) to show their University ID in order to justify their existence in this space (as has occurred on numerous occasions on Stanford campus); postdocs may not be able to work remotely and so be required to work on-site even in the midst of a pandemic; international postdocs may feel less able to speak up about workplace harassment or abuse given their immigration status, particularly so if the harasser/abuser is in a position of power over them; postdocs are also vulnerable to mental health issues. Notably, these risks are in addition to the regular occupational health and safety risks of working in a lab environment.\nRecommendations:\n\nPostdocs themselves (as individuals) should:\n\nmonitor local COVID levels through tracking wastewater on the County COVID Dashboard.16\nutilize Stanford-provided COVID antigen tests as needed.\nfamiliarize themselves with campus safety amenities, such as 5-SURE Safe Rides.17\nwatch out for the safety of others around them (be an upstander, not a bystander).\n\nSURPAS (postdocs collectively) should:\n\ncontinue to advocate for more community oversight for the campus police (Stanford Department of Public Safety).\ncontinue to advocate for clearer communication from Stanford Admin around public health concerns (including pandemics).\ncontinue to offer spaces and opportunities for postdocs to raise issues that have affected them or that they are concerned about.\nact in solidarity with Faculty, Admin, and other campus stakeholders to ensure that all postdocs (and everyone else) are safe at all times.\n\nStanford Faculty should:\n\nensure cultures of safety in the laboratory are developed and adhered to.\nbe attuned to the safety concerns of their group members by asking them about it.\nadvocate to Stanford Admin for improvements in safety amenities across campus to ensure that everyone is safe at all times.\n\nStanford Admin should:\n\ncontinue to ensure stringent laboratory safety protocols and strong cultures of experimental safety through Environmental Health & Safety.\nrestore full service of Marguerite Shuttles on campus to pre-pandemic levels.\nmandate anti-racist training for members of Stanford University Department of Public Safety.\nproactively invite postdocs to meetings and reports from the Community Board on Public Safety.18\nallow for postdocs and other community members to opt in to continued surveillance testing beyond antigen testing for symptomatic individuals (e.g. nucleic acid-based provided through Color during the pandemic).\nensure walkways on campus are well-lit and emergency access points are available.\ncontinue to provide ready access to mental health services for postdocs.\n\nFunding Bodies should:\n\nfactor compliance with professional codes of conduct in funding decisions.\n\nPublishing and Professional Organizations should:\n\ncreate and enforce codes of conduct for membership.\nresearch and report on mental health challenges within the postdoc population.\n\nLocal Community should:\n\n(undergraduate and graduate student bodies) work in solidarity with SURPAS to advocate for improved safety measures across campus.\n\nSanta Clara County Board of Supervisors should:\n\ncreate an easy to access mechanism for members of the Stanford community to report any topics related to the Stanford Department of Public Safety that may require the Board to exercise its oversight authority. Stanford Department of Public Safety employees are deputized by the Santa Clara County’s Sheriff Office but are private employees of Stanford University.

Run through mission of Long-Range Planning Committee (3 min)\n\nSURPAS is engaging in a long range planning process to build a shared collective vision of the future of postdocs at Stanford. During this collaborative process, we are seeking participation and feedback from all interested postdocs as we formalize the expectations, hopes, and goals regarding life as a postdoc. This will be a community-oriented, bottom-up process to assess the broad vision and strategic goals of the postdoc community and provide clear communication of these to all postdocs now and into the future, as well as to other stakeholders. After synthesizing the feedback from our community, the Long Range Planning Committee will produce a publically accessible report detailing the positive aspects of being a postdoc at Stanford as well as where we would like to see change. This report will serve as a vehicle to coordinate advocacy for postdocs through time. Many issues brought before SURPAS require sustained advocacy for a number of years to bring about change. The long range planning process is a means of detailing what work postdocs believe need to be done, providing recommendations for how to achieve change, and setting mile markers that future postdocs can use in their advocacy efforts.\n\nd.

    "text": "Upon completion of a draft of this Report, the Committee sent a copy to members of the SURPAS Leadership Team for feedback on January 27, 2023. An updated draft incorporating suggestions from the Leadership Team was sent to the full SURPAS Council and all postdoc Affinity Groups on February 10, 2023 in advance of discussion at the February 23, 2023 SURPAS Council meeting. At the February Council meeting, members of the Committee gave a presentation on the structure of the Report along with key findings (see slides at the end of this Appendix). The Committee asked for feedback from the full Council and the general postdoc population within the period February 10 to March 10, 2023. Beginning on March 13, 2023, the Committee began incorporating feedback from the general postdoc community for a final draft version sent out to SURPAS Council on March 24, 2023.\n\n\n\nAt the SURPAS Council meeting on March 30, 2023, Committee members proposed a motion for SURPAS Council to officially adopt the Report (motion included at the end of this Appendix). Officially adopting the Report allowed for the SURPAS name and logo to be utilized on the Report and included posting a publicly accessible version online, advertising the Report across social media channels, and empowering the Committee to share the results beyond the postdoctoral community at Stanford as outlined in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n\nA copy of the Report was sent to the Stanford Graduate Student Council and Undergraduate Senate with a request that they officially pass a resolution to bring the report to the agenda of the Stanford Faculty Senate. Committee members presented key findings and recommendations to the Faculty Senate. The full Report was sent to the following administrators directly: (1) Sofie Kleppner, Associate Vice Provost and Associate Dean, head of the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs; Stacey Bent, Vice Provost of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs; and Kam Moler, Vice Provost and Dean of Research; (2) Lloyd Minor, Dean of the School of Medicine; Debra Satz, Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences; Jennifer Widom, Dean of the Engineering School; Arun Majumdar, Dean of the Doerr School of Sustainability; Daniel Schwartz, Dean of the School of Education; Jonathan Levin, Dean of the Graduate School of Business; and Jennifer Martinez, Dean of the Law School; (3) Persis Drell, Provost; and Marc Tessier-Lavigne, President; and (4) the Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University.\nA full copy of the Report was sent to postdoc associations across the United States. The Report was submitted to NIH Request for Information NOT-OD-23-084, Re-envisioning U.S. Postdoctoral Research Training and Career Progression within the Biomedical Research Enterprise. The Report was sent to Lightoller LLC, a non-profit dedicated to supporting the people who make up the research enterprise. A copy of the Report was submitted to the Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara County with a request that the County proactively include Postdocs in their outreach to stakeholders within the community during any future discussions about adoption of a new General Use Permit to govern any expansion of Stanford University.\nThe Committee is directed to write a press release with a link to the report to be sent to local (The Stanford Daily, Embarcadero Media), Regional (San Jose Mercury News, San Francisco Chronicle), and National (The New York Times, The Boston Globe) newspapers.\nThe Committee is empowered to write follow up articles for publication, describing and advertising the Report more broadly.

    "title": "Postdocs at Stanford",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This section of the Report concerns how postdocs are officially defined by various institutions involved in the academic research enterprise.\n\n\nIn 2007, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) agreed on the definition of a postdoc as “an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path.”1 For intramural postdocs, the NIH further clarifies that “applicants for postdoctoral [sic] must have less than 5 years of relevant research experience since the receipt of their doctoral degrees.”2\n\n\n\nStanford University’s Research Policy Handbook3 defines a postdoc as the following: “A Stanford postdoctoral scholar is a non-matriculated trainee, in graduate student status, in residence at Stanford University pursuing advanced studies beyond the doctoral level in preparation for an independent career. Postdoctoral Scholars are appointed for a limited period of time and may participate on Stanford research projects and/or may be supported by external awards or fellowships. In all cases, their appointment at Stanford is for the purpose of advanced studies, research, and training under the mentorship of a Stanford faculty member.”\nDoctorate-holding researchers at Stanford may only be a “postdoc” for a maximum of five years. It is not uncommon for postdocs who have reached the five-year time limit to be appointed as a research staff member for an additional one to two years. During this time, day-to-day work responsibilities (most often) remain the same as when the researcher was a “postdoc”. These researchers can continue working at Stanford for years on consecutive short term contracts.\nSome early career PhD researchers come to Stanford with external funding. These researchers are sometimes classified as Visiting Scholars rather than postdocs and are therefore not guaranteed to be paid the University Minimum Postdoc Salary depending on their individual funding source. There are many non-tenure track PhD-holding researchers at Stanford, only some of whom are officially classified as postdocs.\nFor academic workers at Stanford, these definitions often feel like we are Schrödinger’s Postdoc - we exist in a superposition of student and employee until observation collapses us into whatever category is convenient for the University in that particular case.1\n\n\n\nThe Office of the Vice President for Research at MIT says postdocs “are valued members of MIT’s community, playing critical roles as trainees and partners in our academic research enterprise. Working under the supervision of MIT faculty members, postdoctoral scholars come to MIT to develop their scholarly competence… Postdocs join the MIT community soon after receiving their doctorate, and their length of stay varies depending on area of interest and individual circumstances. Since the postdoctoral position is not intended to be long-term, MIT limits the postdoctoral period to four years, with promotion to the rank of senior postdoctoral associate after three years. Extension for a fifth year or promotion to research scientist requires a dean’s or VPR approval.”4 Postdocs can be appointed as Postdoctoral Fellows or Associates based on whether researchers receive a salary from MIT or are paid by fellowship or stipend.5\n\n\n\nPostdocs at Harvard may be employed by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences/School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (FAS/SEAS), Harvard Medical School, or the School of Public Health. The FAS Postdoctoral Fellows’ Handbook states “Postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) come to Harvard University for further training in their chosen discipline under the general supervision of one or more Harvard faculty members. The FAS and SEAS recognize that postdocs are critical engines to our research and educational enterprise, contributing significantly to the discovery and creation of new knowledge, and helping to guide the research of undergraduate and graduate students… Postdoctoral Fellows and Research Associates are not faculty, staff, or students, but researchers in training.”6 The Office for Postdoctoral Fellows at Harvard Medical School says “the engine of the basic research laboratories at HMS is the postdoctoral workforce,” but admits that “as trainees, postdoctoral fellows are not considered students, staff, or faculty and therefore exist outside of the established policies and procedures for those populations.”7 At the School of Public Health, “postdoctoral research fellows are trainees working in apprenticeship mode in preparation for a career as scientific professionals.”8\nThe FAS Postdoctoral Fellows’ Handbook defines the term “Postdoc” as research scholars who have recently completed a doctoral degree and are temporarily engaged in research in the FAS/SEAS and divides them into four categories of researchers:6\n\n“Employee” postdocs, who are supported by research grants and contracts or internal Harvard funding under the direction of a Harvard Principal Investigator.\n“Stipendiary” postdocs, who receive a fellowship that is managed by Harvard University. In this case the fellow is paid through Harvard.\n“External” postdocs, who are paid directly by an external entity and are, therefore, not paid through Harvard.\n“Research Associates”, who, ordinarily, have had at least three years of postdoctoral experience and are continuing their research under the general supervision of one or more faculty members.\n\n\n\n\nPostdocs at UC Berkeley are engaged in “rigorous research experiences that offer recent Ph.D. recipients a chance to pursue their research agendas, build on their degrees, hone their skills and abilities, prepare to launch their professional careers, and take the next step in their professions… Initial postdoc appointments are full-time positions that typically last between one and two years, up to a maximum reappointment of five years with a rare exception of a sixth year.”9 Across the entirety of the UC system, postdocs are officially defined in the tentative agreement unionized postdocs ratified in late 202210 as (1) “an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path. (2) Postdoctoral Scholars train under the direction and supervision of faculty mentors in preparation for academic or research careers. (3) In addition to pursuing advanced preparation in research, Postdoctoral Scholars may be approved to engage in other activities to enhance teaching and other professional skills. If formal teaching duties are assigned, a Postdoctoral Scholar will be assigned both a Postdoctoral Scholar title and an appropriate teaching title. (4) Ordinarily, Postdoctoral Scholars are not permitted to serve as principal investigators on extramurally sponsored contracts or grant applications. Because the University recognizes that proposal preparation is an important aspect of most postdoctoral training, campuses may permit Postdoctoral Scholars to serve as principal investigators on such applications that are restricted to Postdoctoral Scholars, or in other circumstances approved by the University. Applications for Principal Investigator status shall be carefully considered. (5) The provisions of this section are not grievable.” Depending on funding source, postdocs at UC may be classified according to different employment codes while all falling under the above definition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following demographic information was taken from the publicly accessible version of the Stanford University IDEAL Dashboard representing the 2022-2023 academic year.11 In total, there are 2,474 postdocs with a male:female ratio of 54:46 (these data do not include an intersex option). More than 60% of postdocs are international. There are more postdocs than faculty (2,304). There are three times as many undergraduates (7,761) as there are postdocs and nearly four times as many graduate students (9,565). There are six and a half times as many staff (16,107) as postdocs. Nearly half of postdocs have dependents. Based on insurance enrollment data shared with SURPAS in 2022, 26% of postdocs have their spouse as a dependent on their health insurance, 15% cover both spouse and children, and 2% cover children with no spouse. That adds to a total of 43% of postdocs with dependents, which serves as a lower limit; some postdocs have partners working outside of academia who may cover postdocs or their families with their health insurance.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Population Headcount Comparison of Undergraduate Students, Graduate Students, Postdoctoral Scholars, Professoriate Faculty, and Staff. Total numbers for each population are included as well as population breakdown by binary sex (Female/Male/Decline to State) and Race/Ethnicity Groups. Source: IDEAL Dashboards.11\n\n\nIn addition to the slice-in-time data about various populations within Stanford, the IDEAL dashboard has headcount trends of populations between the 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 academic years broken down across the following demographics: sex, race/ethnicity, and underrepresented minority status.\n\n\nIn the 2010-2011 academic year, the postdoctoral population was 60% male and 40% female, with a total population of 1,846. In 2022-2023, there were 2,474 postdocs with a 54% male/46% female split. The change in total postdoctoral population during this time represents a 1.3x increase. Sex ratios for other groups in 2022-2023 are as follows (male:female): Undergraduate: 48:52; Graduate Student: 55:45; Professoriate Faculty: 68:32; Staff: 37:63. There is a clear skew in the breakdown of populations by sex for more senior academic positions, where the professoriate faculty is heavily skewed towards male and academic staff is heavily skewed towards female. This stands in contrast to the relative parity between sexes at earlier career stages. Only data on binary sex is available via the IDEAL Dashboard currently. The University is undertaking a Gender Data Enablement Project to address this shortcoming.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Headcount trends between 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 for Postdoctoral Scholars by sex. Source: IDEAL Dashboards.11\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the Stanford postdoc community is international. This is not further disambiguated by nation of origin or race/ethnicity, making assessment of demographics for a majority of the postdoctoral population limited. In the 2010-2011 academic year, 57% of postdocs were international. That proportion increased to 62% in the 2022-2023 academic year. The next largest group of postdocs are white postdocs, comprising 23% and 20% in the 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 academic years, respectively. In 2010-2011, 7% of postdocs were Asian; in 2022-2023, that percentage was 8%. Approximately 4% of the postdoc population identified as Hispanic/Latino and approximately 2% identified as Black/African American in 2022-2023.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Headcount trends between 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 for Postdoctoral Scholars by Race/Ethnicity. Source: IDEAL Dashboards.11\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the breakdown of postdocs by underrepresented minority status, international scholars, the majority of our community, are lumped into the single category of international/nonresident. This is not further disambiguated by national origin or underrepresented status. In the 2010-2011 academic years, 30% of postdocs were not underrepresented minorities. That fraction remained relatively flat at 28% in 2022-2023. Underrepresented minorities went from 3.5% to 7% of the postdoctoral population between the 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 academic years. That increase in underrepresented minorities seems to have come from a change in the number of postdocs in the unknown/decline to state category, which went from 9% to 3% of postdocs over the same time frame.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Headcount trends between 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 for Postdoctoral Scholars by status as an Underrepresented Minority. Source: IDEAL Dashboards.11\n\n\nMissing from the IDEAL Dashboard data is information on the median tenure of postdocs. How long an individual postdoc remains at the university and information of where postdocs obtain permanent employment after leaving Stanford are absent. Also absent is information regarding previous employment (e.g. coming to Stanford directly from graduate school vs. from another postdoc position)."

    "text": "This section of the Report lays out general trends and figures concerning the postdoctoral workforce, firstly in the United States and then at Stanford University specifically. We draw out key points from the available data, including: in the last ten years, the postdoc population has largely stopped growing while the number of doctorate-holding non-faculty researchers has continued to rise; more than half of postdocs are on temporary visas; postdocs in academia are underpaid; postdoctoral training is required for tenure-track jobs (of which there are few) but not required for non-academic jobs; postdocs at Stanford are paid more than postdocs at many other locations but the cost of living around Stanford is much higher than at most other locations; the Stanford Postdoc Minimum Salary has not kept pace with inflation in recent years; particular groups of postdocs at Stanford are most affected by financial pressures, such as those with dependents; postdocs at Stanford have several avenues for representation within the University but continue to be overlooked.\nThe data in this section are drawn from source documents produced and published by: the federal government, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Academies, National Science Foundation, and National Institutes of Health; state and local governments, such as the California Department of Housing and Community Development; academic researchers and academic journals, whose reports are often based on national or international surveys of postdocs; and, reporting by various media outlets, including The Stanford Daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdocs are a large and critical part of the US academic research ecosystem. In April 2022, the National Science Foundation estimated that there were more than 65,000 academic postdocs working in the United States as of 2020 in the fields of Science, Engineering, and Health.1 This may be a substantial underestimate due to inconsistent job titles across or within institutions.2 The number of Postdoctoral appointees in the US increased steadily between 1980 and 2005, then rose sharply between 2005 and 2010, before largely leveling off between 2010 and 2020 (Figure 1). The number of doctorate-holding Non-Faculty Researchers also increased sharply in the two years before 2010 and have since risen more quickly than the numbers of Postdocs. The growth in Non-Faculty Researchers may represent Postdocs transitioning into staff researcher roles or teaching-focused roles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of Graduate Students, Postdoctoral appointees, and doctorate-holding Non-Faculty Researchers within Science, Engineering, and Health in the US academic workforce between 1979-2020. Source: NSF1. Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\nThe percentage of both Graduate Students and Postdoctoral appointees who are temporary visa holders (i.e. they are not US citizens or permanent residents) has increased since 1980 (Figure 2). For the past 20 years (2000 to 2020), a clear majority of Postdocs working in the United States have been on temporary visas.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The proportion of Graduate Students and Postdoctoral appointees working in the US who are temporary visa holders (i.e. not US citizens or permanent residents) between 1980-2020. Data for doctorate-holding Non-Faculty Researchers were not available. Source: NSF1. Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\nPostdoc subpopulations within different fields of study have grown at different rates, with those fields with fewer postdocs growing most rapidly. For instance, between 2000 and 2008, the number of engineering and social sciences postdocs increased by 64% and 32%, respectively, whereas in life sciences and physical sciences postdoc numbers increased by 22% and 10%, respectively.3,4 Pursuing a postdoc is now a very common career choice for recipients of science and engineering doctorates. From 2009 to 2018, 45.0% of physical sciences and engineering doctoral recipients and 64.8% of life sciences doctoral recipients took postdoctoral employment upon graduation.5 Most postdocs (70-80%) were employed in the academic sector, as opposed to in industry or government sectors. Of those who started a postdoc in academia, one third of them (33-35%) worked in industry 5-6 years later, while more than half (57-62%) stayed in academia, although only 25-33% were in tenure-track positions. Of those who started a postdoc in industry, 65-84% were still in industry 5-6 years later.\nDoctorate-holding Non-Faculty Researchers, a group that does not include postdocs, are more numerous than ever and are likely to experience low job security. There are minimal data available on the employment conditions of doctorate-holding Non-Faculty Researchers, particularly in comparison to Postdocs. It is not clear, for instance, what proportion of Non-Faculty Researchers are in permanent staff scientist positions or on short-term research contracts. Nor is it clear whether or in what way the work performed by Non-Faculty Researchers differs from that performed by Postdocs. We also do not know the immigration status of these workers. Research has shown that the salaries of postdocs are significantly impacted by their precise job title.6 Non-Faculty Researchers may in reality represent a Postdoc by another name. More information is needed on the rapidly growing Non-Faculty Researcher population.\nNon-tenure track positions provide little job security. The proportion of non-tenure track full-time faculty increased from 8.7% to 27.1% at public doctoral universities and from 12.5% to 30.0% at private nonprofit doctoral universities in the decade between 2008-2018, indicating an increase in contingency and decrease in stability for the academic workforce.7 In other words, the tenure track roles most postdocs are pursuing are being removed from the workforce and the lost labor is being performed by those with little stability. Only about a fifth (22%) of contracts for non-tenure track faculty are multi-year and nearly half (47.2%) are for less than 12 months.8 As examples, contingent faculty and adjunct professors, two types of non-tenure track faculty, have been reported to face substantial difficulties up to and including struggling with homelessness.9–11\nShort contracts and low pay for teaching-related roles lead to high staff turnover. Increasing reliance on contingent faculty to teach creates instability in the academic workforce. Each year between 2015 and 2020, at least a quarter of lecturers within the University of California system did not return to teach.12 Low compensation coupled with uncertain, short-term contracts push the skilled PhD workforce that fills teaching positions at many major universities away from academia. This churn in the teaching workforce may also negatively affect student learning outcomes by decreasing teaching continuity. At present, it is unclear what proportion of Postdocs transition to stable long-term employment versus continuing in unstable short-term positions.\nPostdocs are critical for educational outcomes of graduate students. Postdocs perform an integral role in the research and education missions of the University. Postdocs, along with graduate student workers, senior scientists, and research associates, serve as the skilled workforce that carries out the research grants obtained by faculty who serve as principal investigators. Postdocs also bring in their own funding through fellowships and career development grants. Postdocs are indispensable in graduate education, as peer reviewed research has demonstrated that postdoc engagement is a better predictor of graduate student skill development than PI engagement.13 Yet postdoctoral researchers are also trainees themselves, seeking new skills, entering new fields, and seeking career mentorship while developing an independent research program.\nIn the contemporary research environment, institutional forces (i.e. funding agencies) have recognized postdoctoral training as a defined segment of one’s career that can last as long as graduate training. A majority of postdocs at Stanford are in the School of Medicine, where a typical pathway towards an academic career might involve applying for an individual postdoctoral fellowship (e.g. NIH F32, or various similar private fellowships)14–17 for three years of funding followed by a career transition award (e.g. NIH K99/R00 or others)18,19 for two more years as a postdoc before transitioning to an independent role; a total of five or more years as a postdoc. This lengthy training period and the instability resulting from reliance on short-term contracts coincides with a period when postdoctoral scholars are seeking stability to plan for families and retirement. Despite the potential length of postdoctoral training, the position is also inherently transient. At Stanford, postdocs have a five year time limit. However, this time limit is usually spanned with short term contracts of one or two years, resulting in instability in both the short and long term. The longstanding precarity associated with the postdoctoral position came to a crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic when pressures pushed postdocs out of the academic workforce.20–23\n\n\n\nAcademia pays less than non-academia. For professional research scientists, the annual mean wage in academic employment is far lower than outside of academia across all fields surveyed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), including biochemists and biophysicists ($66,060 vs. $121,310), physical scientists ($70,580 vs. $130,680), life scientists ($85,770 vs. $107,740), and physicists ($104,050 vs. $162,240) (Figure 3).24 These numbers from the BLS are echoed in the results from various nation-wide or world-wide surveys of postdocs in recent years, which have concluded that postdocs are an undervalued workforce,25 that there is high disenchantment with working as a postdoc,26 and that the stagnating salaries of postdocs may push potential future postdocs off the academic career track.27 Furthermore, the challenging postdoctoral period comes after the already-challenging graduate school period, during which time researchers may be paid below the living wage and face food insecurity.28,29 Unsurprisingly, immediate financial concerns, such as supporting a family or paying off student loans or saving for retirement, may prevent a researcher from pursuing a postdoc. Given these challenges, those who are actually able to undertake a postdoc are likely to represent individuals who already come from a certain level of privilege.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of salaries for research scientist roles inside versus outside academia.

Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\nNational funding bodies in the United States have known for many years that academic researchers, including postdocs, are underpaid. In the year 2000, the U.S. National Research Council called for an increase in stipends for researchers. (For instance: “Recommendation 5-4. Stipends and other forms of compensation for those in training should be based on education and experience and should be regularly adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of living.” in Chapter 5: Crosscutting Issues in Research Training, in ref30.) In response, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2001 set a target annual stipend of $45,000 for entry-level postdocs and planned to increase then-current stipends by 10 to 12% over the following few years to reach that target before subsequently maintaining the real value of stipends by annual cost-of-living adjustments.31 Starting from $45,000 in September 2001 and adjusted for national average inflation, this target minimum annual postdoc stipend would now (in September 2022) be equivalent to $74,403.32 However, the current NIH minimum postdoc salary is just $54,840 (Figure 4).33 This is a gap of almost $20,000. Notably, these numbers only reflect national salary minimums and do not take into account local cost of living differences. In the case of Stanford University and the San Francisco Bay Area, the local cost of living is substantially higher than for most of the rest of the country, as is detailed below.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of 2001 NIH Target entry-level postdoc salary with that goal adjusted for inflation in 2022 and the actual NIH minimum postdoc salary in 2022. Sources: NIH,33 BLS Inflation Calculator.32 Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\nPursuing an academic postdoc leads to a loss in average lifetime earnings.34 The academic postdoctoral timeline is longer than in non-academic sectors and academic postdoctoral researchers later receive lower salaries, resulting in an overall loss in lifetime earnings (of $3,730 per year of postdoctoral training over a 30 year post-PhD career). Academic postdocs tended to be longer in duration across fields, with an average length of 1.3 - 1.6 years in industry compared with 2.4 - 3.3 years for academic postdoc positions.5 Analysis of salary disaggregated across sectors of employment at year 5-6 shows that those who initially pursued academic postdocs have lower salaries than their peers regardless of where they are eventually employed, except for in tenure-track positions where they are at the median. Meanwhile, those who worked as postdocs in the government sector immediately following receipt of their doctorates had relatively higher salaries, even in the broadly low-paying academic fields. For those who ended up in permanent industry positions, a government postdoc led to a salary advantage of $7,350 over an academic postdoc.5 For career mobility and long-term salary gains, an academic postdoc compares unfavorably to a government postdoc.\nEven late-career, world-leading researchers continue to be deeply affected by the career instability and low wages of academia. Prof. Emmanuelle Charpentier worked at nine institutions in 25 years, an average of less than three years per institution, while performing the work that would earn her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.35 Dr. Katalin Karikó spent years in contingent roles as a doctorate-holding non-faculty researcher pioneering work on mRNA that gave rise to coronavirus vaccines that have helped fight against the global pandemic.36 Dr Jeffery Hall, who received the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on circadian rhythms, left science in part because of his disenchantment with the difficulties in obtaining scientific funding.37 Leon Lederman sold his Nobel Prize at the end of his life to pay for health care costs.38 Job instability and low wages affect many in academia, including postdocs.\n\n\n\nMany postdocs are motivated by the desire to train in cutting-edge research with expert mentors, and in many fields, completing a postdoc is required for pursuing an academic career. Indeed, when asked, a majority of postdocs cite academic research positions as a major career goal.39 However, there are far fewer tenure-track positions available than there are postdocs; only about a fifth of postdocs will go on to tenure-track jobs.5\nThere have been long standing concerns over the treatment of postdocs within the academic research ecosystem. In 2000, the National Academies published a report on how to enhance the postdoctoral experience, citing large variability of the postdoc experience with particular concerns over poor guidance or mentoring; little opportunity for growth towards independence; and mentors, institutions, and funding bodies not assigning postdocs the status, recognition, and compensation that are commensurate with their skills and contributions.40 More than ten years later, one commentator, the chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, lamented that none of the recommendations from the National Academies’ 2000 report had been implemented on a broad scale.41 Another National Academies report published in 2014 again expressed concerns that the experience of postdocs is highly variable and in many cases is far from the ideal. (“2: The Disconnect Between the Ideal and Reality” in ref4.) In particular, the vast imbalance between the large number of postdocs and the small number of available tenure-track faculty positions leads to: extra long postdoctoral periods (>5 years) and sometimes the same person completing multiple postdocs, postdocs taking jobs for which postdoc training is not required, or postdocs subsequently leaving research altogether.\nDespite what seems to be an oversupply of postdocs in the academic system, principal investigators have complained of difficulties in recruiting postdocs, both back in 2015 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.42,43 These hiring difficulties have led some leaders in academia to acknowledge the plight of postdocs and suggest recommendations for how to fix the system.44 These recommendations largely echo the ignored calls of the past 20 years.\nWorryingly for the 75-80% postdocs who do not obtain a tenure-track position, pursuing a postdoc does not necessarily prepare you for a career outside of academia. Several studies have found that the skills postdocs learn in academia are not necessarily sought by employers outside of academia.45 Therefore, despite having undertaken advanced training, postdocs face uncertain prospects for their future careers.46\nOne issue that has compounded this uncertainty is the lack of reliable and available data on the career outcomes of postdocs. Within the field of biomedicine, an international group of prominent institutions, called the Coalition for Next Generation Life Science, sought to address this lack in 2017 by announcing a data initiative to track the career outcomes of graduate students and postdocs, which began in 2018.47 Conspicuously absent from this Coalition are the two largest employers of postdocs in the United States – Harvard and Stanford Universities. Data collection efforts to track postdoc career outcomes are long overdue.\nA recent analysis of the hiring dynamics for university faculty across the United States revealed a number of potentially concerning details. This 2022 study revealed an intense “prestige hierarchy” in the production of faculty.48 A minority of universities produce an outsized proportion of eventual faculty. Only 11% of US faculty hold doctorates from international universities. For faculty who received their doctorate within the US, just 20.4% of universities produced 80% of the faculty. Moreover, nearly 14% of faculty received their PhDs at one of five institutions – University of California Berkeley, Harvard University, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Stanford University. While postdoctoral training was not considered in the analysis, these results certainly have implications for those pursuing a career as faculty within academia. As a result of the current lack of data on postdoc career outcomes, it is unclear the extent to which completing a postdoc at Stanford contributes to success (or otherwise) in gaining a faculty position. Depending on a researcher’s training background, these hiring dynamics may lower the odds of obtaining a faculty position. The existing data indicate that cities that produce the highest proportion of tenure track faculty are also associated with higher cost of living, while postdoctoral salaries fail to account for disparities in cost of living.49\n\n\n\n\nWith 2400 postdocs, Stanford’s share of the total US postdoc population is approximately 4%. (2400 / 65,000 x 100 = 3.69%) Given that there are some 280 R1 and R2 institutions in the US,44 this is a very large fraction for a single institution to hold. Stanford was one of the first institutions to have a formal postdoctoral association, with the Stanford University Postdoctoral Association founded in 1998. At that time, there were 1200 postdocs at Stanford. As of 2023, there are nearly 2500 postdocs at Stanford. The postdoctoral association is now known as SURPAS. SURPAS aims to represent all postdocs at Stanford. SURPAS is run entirely by volunteers who are all postdocs at Stanford. SURPAS receives funding from the University via the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs.\n\n\nStanford University pays postdocs more than the minimum postdoc salary set by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This has been the case since at least 2014, and for each year between 2018 and 2022 Stanford’s Postdoc Minimum Salary exceeded the NIH’s by at least $11,500 (Figure 5, left panel, and Appendix D, Table 5). This is a substantial difference, representing at least 22% higher salary compared to the NIH minimum each year between 2018 and 2022.\nHowever, whereas the NIH postdoc salary increases for each additional year of postdoc experience, Stanford’s postdoc salary does not increase at all for 0 to 5 years of postdoc experience (Figure 5, right panel, and Appendix D, Table 7). A postdoc who started at Stanford in 2018 fresh out of their PhD (PhD + 0 years experience) and received the Stanford minimum salary was $11,568 (22%) better off than the NIH minimum salary, but by their fifth year at Stanford on the minimum salary (2022; PhD + 5 years experience) they were only $6246 (10%) better off than the NIH minimum. A survey of postdocs at Stanford conducted by the Stanford Postdoc Association (SURPAS) Leadership Team in December 2021 found that 53% of respondents were being paid at the minimum salary and an additional 30% were on less than $72,000 per year (equivalent to 110% of the minimum salary; see SURPAS Benefits and Affordability Survey (Winter 2021/22)). Increased transparency around Stanford postdoc remuneration across different years of experience, different fields/departments, different funding mechanisms, and different Principal Investigators would enable a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity (or homogeneity) of postdoc personal finances.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of Stanford Postdoc Salary and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Postdoc Salary since 2012. Left: Minimum Postdoc Salaries from Stanford and the NIH. Right: Postdoc Salaries by Number of Years Experience post-PhD.

Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\nThe cost of living around Stanford is extremely high relative to other locations in the US and this may be one reason that Stanford’s Minimum Postdoc Salary is higher than that of the NIH. A 2018 analysis of data drawn from a 2016 US national postdoc survey put postdoc salaries into the context of the local cost of living across a variety of locations around the US (Figure 6).39 Postdocs at Stanford, despite receiving near to the highest absolute salaries, were placed among the lowest in the country in terms of real wages (see “Santa Clara, CA” in Figure 6). (Stanford University is an unincorporated area within Santa Clara County.) Notably, in the year of this national survey (2016) Stanford’s Minimum Postdoc Salary was actually 22% higher than the NIH Minimum (Appendix D, Table 5), indicating that even with a salary substantially exceeding the NIH Minimum Stanford’s postdocs remain very financially disadvantaged compared to postdocs living in almost every other location within the US.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Comparison of 2016 postdoc salaries in absolute dollars and normalized to cost of living, ordered from lowest to highest based on adjusted salary. Data in this graph is based upon the results of a 2016 U.S. national postdoc survey. Each location included in this graph had more than 50 postdoc respondents. Source: McConnell et al., (2018) eLife. Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\nFurthermore, increases to the Stanford Postdoc Minimum Salary over the past several years have not kept pace with inflation. Postdocs at Stanford received a 2% and 4% year-on-year increase to the Minimum Salary in the past two years (academic years 2020/21 to 2021/22 and 2021/22 to 2022/23, respectively) (Appendix D, Table 1a). The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that for the months August 2021 and August 2022 the 12-month percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA metropolitan area was 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Therefore, the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary has lagged CPI by 1.7% for each of the past two years, representing $2207 in lost purchasing power over those two years ($64,268 x 1.037 x 1.057 = $70,445 versus actual 2022 salary of $68,238).\nA comparison of the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary with the Area Median Income (AMI) of Santa Clara County (in which Stanford University is located) similarly reveals that postdocs at Stanford, and certain groups in particular, are not well off (Figure 7). In 2022 in Santa Clara County, single-earner households of any size with a postdoc on the Stanford Postdoc Minimum Salary (Figure 7, black dashed line) were either Low or Very Low Income. A single-parent postdoc with any number of dependents was Very Low Income. Double-earner households with two postdocs on the Minimum Salary (Figure 7, black dot-dash line) without any dependents (“2 person household”) are at the 2022 Median Income but dip below it with one dependent and are close to Low Income with two dependents. (Postdocs may choose for their dependents to not be enrolled on their Stanford health insurance, for instance if their partner has access to alternative health insurance.) Based on health insurance enrollment, at least 43% of postdocs at Stanford have dependents, which means that a sizable portion of the postdoc population exists within a household of more than one person and may need to cover more than just their own personal expenses on their postdoc salary.\nThe federally-funded housing assistance program, Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8), organized through the Santa Clara County Housing Authority is available to households whose income falls below the Very Low Income level (50% AMI) (Figure 7, bright red line).51 In 2022, this level was $67,400 for a 2-person household and $75,850 for a 3-person household. The 2022 Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary was $68,238. This means that a postdoc with two or more dependents, who was the sole income-earner and was on the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary, would have been eligible for federal housing assistance. A postdoc in the same situation but with only one dependent earned just $838 too much to qualify for federal housing assistance. This rental assistance program allows for recipients to pay just 30% of their gross income on rent, with the remainder paid for by the program.\nRegardless of household size, over the past three years (2019-2022) postdocs at Stanford have lost ground relative to the local Area Median Income levels (Figure 7). Since 2019, increases in the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary have not kept pace with increases in the AMI for Santa Clara County, leading to a substantial decrease in the real wages of postdocs at Stanford. A Minimum Postdoc Salary of $81,000 in 2022 would return postdocs at Stanford to the pre-2019 relative income level.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary with Area Median Income (AMI) levels for Santa Clara County (the county in which Stanford is located), including federally defined (by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD) definitions of Moderate, Median, Low, Very Low, and Extremely Low Income. Twice the Postdoc Minimum Salary is also included in graphs for households of 2 or more persons. Sources: California HCD,52 Office for Postdoctoral Affairs50 and email correspondence. Refer to Appendix D: Data Tables for raw data used to prepare this graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow salaries for postdocs at Stanford lead to very real financial hardships, up to and including struggling to meet basic needs. Housing is likely to be the largest regular expense for postdocs at Stanford. The cost of housing in the San Francisco Bay Area is very high, with those areas closest to Stanford being at or close to the most expensive in the Bay.53 Average effective monthly rent in the City of San Jose, Santa Clara County, was $2,635 in the fourth quarter of 2022.54 Renters must earn $117,560 per year to afford the average effective monthly rent for a 2-bedroom apartment (the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary was $68,238 in 2022/23). The US Census also reported that the median gross rent for Santa Clara County between 2017-21 was $2,530.55 The U.S. federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines someone who spends more than 30% of their income on rent as Rent Burdened. For a postdoc on the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary in 2022/23, 30% of their pre-tax monthly salary is $1,706. ($68,238 / 12 * 0.30 = $1705.95) This is $929 less than the City of San Jose figure for average effective monthly rent in Q4 2022 and $824 less than the US Census figure for median gross rent in 2017-21. According to a December 2021 postdoc survey (see SURPAS Benefits and Affordability Survey (Winter 2021/22)), almost half of postdocs at Stanford (47%) pay more than $2000 per month for housing, making them Rent Burdened. Many postdocs at Stanford (25% or ~600 individuals) live with roommates. (“Roommates” does not include a partner or dependent/s.)\nFor postdocs with families, living with roommates is not likely to be an option. Some postdoc families make ends meet by having a partner who works in a higher paying field than academia; others separate geographically from their family for the duration of their postdoc; still others take out loans to join the postdoctoral workforce (see Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association Survey (Fall 2022).56\nPostdocs are eligible to apply for Stanford on-campus housing. However, because postdocs are classified as “non-matriculated students”, they have no priority and no guarantee of receiving an offer for on-campus housing. (Direct communications with a representative from Stanford Residential & Dining Enterprises (https://rde.stanford.edu/), March 2023.) In reality, this meant that very few, if any, postdocs received on-campus housing. This was the case until 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic led to a huge decrease in the demand for on-campus housing from (matriculated) students. At this point, a number of postdocs were able to access on-campus housing. However, when (matriculated) students returned to campus in Fall 2022, some postdocs were evicted from on-campus housing with only three weeks notice.57 Shortly afterwards, Stanford announced the purchase of additional housing near campus where postdocs are to have the highest priority.58 The addition of postdoc-specific Stanford housing is extremely welcome and long awaited amongst the postdoc community. However, concerns remain over the affordability of these units, given prevailing market rates and current postdoc salaries (see Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association Housing Costs Letter (2022). Even with the recently added 759 postdoc-specific units, the majority of Stanford’s more than 2400 postdocs will still live off campus and need to find housing in the Bay Area.\nStanford does not provide financial assistance for postdocs relocating to Stanford. The cost of relocation expenses raises a barrier to economically disadvantaged postdocs joining the academic workforce (see Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association Survey (Fall 2022). This initial period often comes with additional financial burdens on top of regular rent and utility bills, including paying for a security deposit, first and last month’s rent, and purchasing of furniture and other necessary items. Stanford has recently piloted a transitional housing program to provide a landing place for new postdocs moving to the Bay Area.59 These housing units, while fully furnished and not requiring a security deposit, are offered at market rates and are therefore expensive. At $2700 per month for a one-bedroom unit, this is almost half of a postdoc’s pre-tax monthly minimum salary. The transitional nature of this housing means the maximum length of stay is 4 months.\nA significant number of postdocs at Stanford suffer from food insecurity. At a SURPAS Council meeting in late 2019, it was reported that nearly 10% of postdocs suffered from food insecurity. A subsequent survey of postdocs at Stanford in December 2021 bore this out, finding that more than one-third (36%) suffered from some level of food insecurity: either Occasionally (22.9%), Sometimes (7.6%) or Often (5.1%) (see SURPAS Benefits and Affordability Survey (Winter 2021/22)). There is a pop-up food pantry on campus that provides undergraduate and graduate students and their affiliates with additional food support at no cost.60 Postdocs avail themselves of this essential service too. However, as of January 2023, postdocs are no longer eligible to use this service.\nPostdocs with dependents must contend with additional financial burdens. Health insurance and childcare for dependents represent major and essential expenses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, premiums to cover dependents on the postdoc health insurance plan increased by 60%. Following an outcry from postdocs (including the SURPAS Family Committee Letter (2020/21)), Stanford offered a mechanism by which these added health insurance costs would increase over the course of 12 months, rather than be incurred by postdocs with dependents immediately.1 At around the same time (February 2021), Stanford initiated three new financial aid programs for postdocs (Child Care Assistance Grant Program, Family Grant Program, Back-up Child Care Assistance (BUCA)) and expanded a fourth program (Emergency Grant in Aid).2 For childcare, Stanford offers an emergency relief fund to help offset its large cost.61 However, the maximum benefit from this fund is $5000 per year, while childcare costs can easily reach $2500 per month, meaning that this provision may only cover a sixth of total annual childcare costs. Suffice it to say, paying for only the essentials – housing, healthcare, childcare, and food – as a postdoc with dependents in the Bay Area is extremely difficult, if not impossible, on the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary, even after a postdoc maximizes targeted funding provisions from Stanford.\n\n\n\nStanford has an institutional postdoctoral office called the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA), which is focused entirely on assisting postdocs at Stanford.62 The OPA expanded its headcount in 2021 and now has 13 staff members. Many academic research institutions still lack such an office and postdocs at Stanford are very fortunate to have an office dedicated to them. (Only 36% (101 out of 280) of R1 and R2 institutions have a specific office dedicated to postdoc affairs. From ref44.) Research has shown that access to an institutional postdoctoral office is correlated with mitigation of some stress associated with darkened outlooks on future career opportunities for postdocs during the COVID-19 pandemic.63,64\nLeaders of the Stanford postdoctoral association, SURPAS, meet regularly with OPA staff in order to advocate for improved conditions. SURPAS has a yearly operating budget composed of funds deposited from a line item in the OPA budget disbursed in Fall of each year. The Dean’s Office from the School of Medicine and the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs also contribute funds to specific events, such as the Postdoc Symposium, Diversity Perspectives Seminar Series, or the Family Committee Fall Festival. Other than the yearly deposit from OPA, any additional funds must be applied for by the SURPAS Leadership Team. Consistently one of the largest single line item expenses on the SURPAS budget for the past decade has been the cost of buying drinks for a barbeque held by OPA during National Postdoc Appreciation Week in September, which typically takes place at the end of the SURPAS budget cycle.3\nSURPAS Leadership also represents the needs of postdocs on the Provost’s Advisory Committee on Postdoctoral Affairs (PACPA). SURPAS co-chairs have a non-voting seat on both the university-wide Faculty Senate and the School of Medicine Faculty Senate. In addition to the SURPAS Leadership Team and SURPAS Council, which are the two elected representative bodies of the Stanford postdoctoral community, there are also several postdoctoral affinity groups that represent and seek to build community amongst postdocs with specific identities. At present (2023), these affinity groups are: the Stanford Black Postdoc Association (SBPA), the Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association (SLPA), LGBTQIA+ Postdocs, and the Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association (SCPA). These affinity groups are independent of SURPAS but frequently collaborate with SURPAS.\nPostdoctoral issues have been raised with the University Administration over many years, including through various working groups of the University’s Long Range Planning of 2017/18.65 In 2017, organized postdocs at Stanford sounded a note of optimism following a meeting with senior University leadership figures at Stanford in expectation of a productive working relationship to address years of being treated as “second class citizens” within Stanford.66 However, postdocs at Stanford have continued to be overlooked. During the pandemic, postdocs received no institutional support in the form of funding extensions similar to the faculty tenure clock extension.67 Postdocs also received no communication from Stanford about their COVID-19 vaccine eligibility until April 26, 2021, eleven days after all Californians were eligible for vaccination and more than six weeks after postdocs became eligible as workers in the education sector.68\n\n\n\n\nThis section of the Report has laid out, in broad strokes, the system-wide situation of academic postdocs within the US and then specifically the situation of postdocs at Stanford. We have drawn from a wide range of reputable sources to synthesize some key throughlines: postdocs have been consistently undervalued and underpaid since the conception of the postdoc role; more than half of the postdocs in the US are on temporary visas; postdoc experiences vary widely and in the majority of cases do not lead to tenure-track positions; pursuing an academic postdoc is correlated with decreased average lifetime earnings; repeated calls over many years to improve conditions for postdocs, for instance by increasing pay and increasing structures for accountability, have not resulted in widespread changes.\nThe situation for postdocs at Stanford is both better and worse than the broader picture. Stanford pays its postdocs more than the NIH minimum. But postdocs at Stanford get paid less in real wages. They get paid less compared to postdocs living in other parts of the US (due to high local cost of living). They get paid less now compared to postdocs at Stanford several years ago (due to salaries not keeping up with inflation). They get paid less relative to their work experience the longer they remain a postdoc at Stanford (due to a flat salary structure). And they get paid less now compared to Stanford’s local Area Median Income (due to salaries not keeping up with local wages). This low salary is particularly challenging for certain groups of postdocs, including those with dependents, due to very high costs for housing, child care, and health insurance. Postdocs at Stanford have several avenues for representation within the University (unlike at many other institutions) but continue to be overlooked.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "The Long Range Planning Committee sought feedback on the Report as outlined in Appendix C: Communication Strategy of Report. Postdocs had opportunities to provide feedback through discussion at Council meetings, via asynchronous comments on the draft of the Report, and via personal meetings and emails with Committee members. This feedback was incorporated into the body of the Report at the appropriate locations.\nThe Committee felt that several of these conversations were very important and warranted more extensive inclusion in the Report. Thus, major discussion topics and how the Committee engaged with the community’s feedback are briefly outlined in this section.\n–\n\n\nDuring the feedback period (Feb 9 - Mar 10, 2023), the draft Report (a Google Doc) had 74 unique viewers, and received 173 new comments and 91 replies to comments.\nGiven the length of the Report (100+ pages), the Committee suggested that any interested postdocs should focus their attention on the Executive Summary and the Recommendations sections. Accordingly, we received the most feedback on the Executive Summary and many comments on the Recommendations section. However, feedback was not limited to these sections; most of the other sections of the Report also received some feedback.\n\n\n\nSome commenters felt that the Report had not sufficiently emphasized the critical role that postdocs play within the University and the broader research ecosystem. Whilst the living and working conditions of postdocs as human beings should be treated with the utmost importance, the Committee fully understands that research institutions and organizations will judge the value of postdocs by their work output. Within this framing, it is still highly justifiable for postdocs to be treated with higher value than they currently are.\nPostdocs are an indispensable group of researchers who are important to the University and its research output. They play a crucial role in designing, executing, and performing research experiments while also assisting in writing grants, and supervising graduate and undergraduate students. Postdocs are generally the ones that drive research projects leading to high-impact publications and in some cases are also necessary for competing against other research institutions. Overall, without the contribution of postdocs as an essential backbone to academia, there would be serious repercussions to the University’s research output.\n\n\n\nA number of commenters requested that the Report should include more detail around particular comments or conclusions that are drawn within the text of the Report. Many of these requests were directed at the Executive Summary (“What are the numbers behind this statement?”) or, less frequently, at specific items in the Recommendations section.\nThe Committee took the view that the Executive Summary should be as concise as possible (two pages at maximum) and also cover as many of the findings from the rest of the Report as possible. For the sake of brevity, we have excluded most specific numbers from the Executive Summary. However, as trained academic researchers, we understand the need to back up our claims with solid evidence, be it with citations or the data themselves. In the body of the Report (and in particular the Competitive Landscape section), we strove to include as much detail as was necessary to fully back up any and all claims that we make elsewhere in the Report (including in the Executive Summary). Wherever possible, we included in the body and appendices of the Report the exact numbers, calculations, raw data, and sources for these data. The Committee is not faultless and we accept that despite our best efforts there may still be errors within the final version of the Report.\nThe Committee also accepts that there are more data and sources out there that we did not include in this Report. We welcome the Report being built upon in future through more in-depth investigations into the situation of postdocs (perhaps conducted by non-volunteers). Nevertheless, given the substantial number of sources that we did consult through the Long Range Planning process, we feel confident in both our specific claims and in our general statements about the situation of postdocs, both in the US broadly and at Stanford.\n\n\n\nThe question of “Specifically, what Postdoc Minimum Salary are you proposing? No, really, what is the exact number?” was brought to the Committee by multiple people at different times. The intense interest in postdoc salary is not surprising given the amount of financial stress that postdocs at Stanford live under. We believe that the pervasiveness of this concern has been reflected by the prominent inclusion of this issue in every section of this Report. Indeed, of the 17 different issues that we identified in the Recommendations section of the Report, six of these issues were explicitly about the financial cost of being a postdoc at Stanford. Clearly, this is a critical issue.\nHowever, in this Report, the Committee has refrained from holding up a single number as the overarching conclusion of our work. The reasoning for this decision is largely philosophical: the Long Range Planning Committee was tasked with crafting a vision for the future of postdocs towards the year 2030, not with generating specific salary recommendations for the current fiscal cycle (although such a “postdoc salary committee” could prove to be a valuable support to the efforts of the SURPAS Co-Chairs in advocating for heavily-evidenced and well-justified salary increases with the Provost). We are utterly convinced that postdocs at Stanford are underpaid and should be paid considerably more than they are at present. All of our analyses, both through hard numbers and through a multitude of personal narratives, points to this conclusion. However, any single number that we might advocate for in the present moment (March 2023) will quickly become outdated, and especially so given the recent high levels of inflation. Instead, in an effort to make this Report both more relevant and more useful throughout this next decade, we have sought to unearth useful data and provide new comparisons that could be utilized by current and future postdoc leaders at Stanford to advocate for specific Postdoc Minimum Salaries moving forward.\nWe hope that the general principles we have outlined (e.g. postdocs should not be required to spend more than 30% of their income on housing) and the types of analyses that we have done in this Report (e.g. the Postdoc Minimum Salary versus the Area Median Income for the local area of the University) provide some guidance and a starting point for future advocacy efforts.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Stanford limits the time that an individual can be a postdoc to 5 years. The suggestion from the Committee in the draft Executive Summary that the postdoc period should not be limited to 5 years (i.e. that the postdoc period should be allowed to extend for longer than 5 years) attracted questioning and pushback from a number of commenters. Several noted that a postdoc is “meant to be” a transitional period within an academic career and it would be undesirable for this transition to extend longer than 5 years (which is already considered by some to be an excessively long period of time). Another commenter stated plainly:\n\n“I think if the postdoc period is not limited to 5 years they will be exploited even further.”\n\nThe Committee appreciates this feedback and welcomes the pragmatism in these comments. However, we maintain that one aspiration for the future of postdocs should be to remove the 5-year limit, whilst also necessarily addressing the major causes of postdoc suffering.\nThe Committee’s position rests on a number of understandings:\n\nQuality academic research does not often fit within prescribed timelines. A particular project may take longer to complete than 5 years; or, an individual postdoc may take longer than 5 years to collect the requirements for moving into a faculty position within a particular discipline. From the perspective of optimizing for research outcomes (i.e. academia being primarily about knowledge creation), it does not necessarily follow that research time should be artificially limited. From the perspective of optimizing for career satisfaction (given that many researchers find, or at least seek, deeper meaning in their work than just money), it does not necessarily follow that each individual should proceed in their career at the same or similar rates.\nIn reality, many postdocs at Stanford already extend beyond 5 years. Although Stanford does not allow postdocs to extend beyond 5 years, at this point (after 5 years) many postdocs transition into a research staff position, in which they perform exactly the same job duties as they did as a postdoc. This begs the question: “How is a postdoc different from a research staff member?”. And “If it is no different, why do postdocs not receive the same salary and benefits as a research staff member?”. One common-sense response is: “Postdocs aim to become faculty, whereas research staff do not.” (Clearly not always true.) This leads to the conclusion that postdocs sacrifice salary and benefits for their intention to pursue a faculty position.\nThe research enterprise positions a postdoc as a period of additional training prior to moving into a (tenure-track) faculty position. However, most academic postdocs do not move into faculty positions, so the premise (or promise) of an academic postdoc is false for most.\nThe research enterprise positions a postdoc as a “transitional” period. Given the “transitional nature of a postdoc”, it is apparently acceptable to exploit individuals in this role because the institution does not need to be accountable to them in the longer term. In many careers outside of academia, individuals can stay in positions for far less than 5 years and they are not considered “transitional”. The narrative of “postdocs are transitional” is false and it is a detrimental one for postdocs themselves.\nThe power imbalance between faculty and trainees (postdocs and also graduate students and undergraduates) further exacerbates this issue of exploitation, as does the lack of faculty training in management and mentorship.\nUndertaking a postdoc at Stanford currently involves significant sacrifice and suffering (in terms of salary, quality of life, mental health, etc.) for most individuals, and substantially more for those individuals from less privileged backgrounds (this is perhaps the greatest barrier to diversifying the postdoc population and thereby the professoriate). Nobody wants or aims to be a postdoc; the aim is to become a tenured professor. The sacrifice of a postdoc only makes sense in this context.\nIn the minds of postdocs, the 5-year time limit is primarily a safeguard for limiting the suffering and sacrifice inherent to undertaking a postdoc.\n\nThe key question regarding the postdoc time limit appears to be: What strategy will lead to less exploitation of postdocs?\nThe Committee reasons that the 5-year limit (or any time limit) only makes sense in the context that being a postdoc is unsustainable for individuals in the longer term because of the conditions that we are required to accept. If the conditions of suffering are removed, then there is no good reason to enforce a time limit (which is often not abided by anyway).\nIn seeking to frame a positive vision of the future of postdocs, we feel we cannot endorse the fundamentally damage-centered, harm-reductionist position of: “Let’s accept that postdocs are exploited and just seek to limit the duration of it”. Instead, we choose to endorse a positive, desire-centered vision for the future: “Postdocs are full and valued members of the academic enterprise, and as such they are supported to do great research.” The requirement that postdocs not be exploited comes as a natural extension of this vision. In this context, the primary justification for the 5-year time limit (at least from the postdoc perspective: as a safeguard against additional suffering) is no longer apparent.\nWe understand that this position may lead to fewer postdoc positions being available (for instance, due to budgetary limitations: if postdocs are paid more, then fewer postdocs can be afforded by research groups). However, we believe that this will also lead to less suffering in general.\n\n\n\nThe question of how to define a postdoc arose in multiple ways. Several commenters asked how universal or unique the definition of a postdoc at Stanford is in comparison with that of other institutions. The Committee addressed this question by including multiple definitions of postdocs from peer institutions as a point of comparison.\nSeveral academic researchers who self-identify as postdocs but are not classified as such by the University reached out to the Committee to describe how they were not included in the original draft of the Report, which used Stanford’s Research Policy Handbook for the definition of a postdoc. The description of visiting scholars and postdocs who transition to staff after the five year time limit was added to account for these researchers.\nBy far the topic that received the most comments with regards to the definition of a postdoc was the question of whether postdocs should be classified as employees or trainees. One commenter explicitly said postdocs can have pretty substantial benefits by being able to access perks from both student and staff categories while recognizing it as “a double edged sword… leaving you at the mercy of your department and PI in a lot of ways.” Others worried that classification as staff rather than students or trainees would cause postdocs to lose access to training opportunities. One postdoc highlighted that classification as staff would require domestic postdocs to start paying back student loans, adding a major financial burden to postdocs.\nIn the information gathering efforts of the Committee, we found that the uncertain classification of postdocs usually leads to missed connections in practice. Postdocs tend to be excluded from benefits for either students or staff, rather than being able to access both. As an example, on February 22, 2023 an email was sent to the Stanford community about the university undergoing the once-in-a-decade accreditation process. As part of the process, there was a meeting scheduled for students and postdocs to meet with the accreditation committee. However, postdocs received no communication until they pointed out that administrators had failed to include them in the initial email to the entire campus community. Postdocs are excluded from critical campus communications due to our uncertain status. The definition of Schrodinger’s postdoc - a superposition of student and employee until observation collapses the postdoc into whatever is convenient for the university - resonated with many postdocs.\nThe Committee takes the position that the opposition between classification as a trainee or an employee is a false dichotomy. Classification of postdocs as employees should not remove access to training opportunities. It is common in many career pathways for workers to be able to take advantage of career development opportunities. Academia is not alone in having on-the-job training and entry level positions. In this Report, postdocs call for various forms of training, including university-wide anti-racist training and management and mentorship training for faculty members. It would be absurd for faculty to lose their status as employees simply for partaking in career development and training opportunities. Assistant Professors receive training on the job before being promoted to Associate Professors, and there is no question of whether they are employees. It is not mutually exclusive to be both a trainee and an employee.\nPostdocs lose out on concrete material benefits by not being classified as employees. Postdocs do not receive matched contributions to retirement accounts as is common for workers in many industries. A central principle of compound interest is that even a small principal can grow to large amounts by retirement age for workers by starting early. Postdocs miss out on the potential for matched contributions after already having forwent such plans as graduate students. The difficulty in building assets for the future raises the barrier for people to continue on an academic career track.\nPostdocs should not be classified as students. It is hard to reconcile the current classification of postdocs at Stanford as a type of student with our status as holders of terminal degrees. Achieving the vision for the future of postdocs laid out in this Report will necessarily relieve some of the financial pressures postdocs face, lowering the impact of the requirement for postdocs with student loan debt to begin repaying were this student classification to be removed. The Committee added a recommendation for State and National governments to pursue policies to forgive a certain dollar amount of student loan debt for postdocs for every year of work to reduce the impact of student loan debt on the postdoctoral workforce.\nA reasonable working definition of a postdoc would be a non-administrative, non-tenure track academic worker with a terminal degree. This definition would include postdocs who have transitioned to staff roles as well as academic workers in non-tenured teaching roles. This more inclusive definition of postdocs would enable easier tracking of statistics about the academic workforce, such as the proportion of work performed at universities by non-tenure track employees and how that compares to historical trends. This definition may also help to address the well-documented disparities in pay based on job title (noted in the Competitive Landscape section of this Report).\n\n\n\nSeveral commenters took issue with the data that we presented on postdoc demographics at Stanford. Specifically, the demographics data included a category for “Sex” (with binarized responses: “Male” or “Female” or “Unknown/Decline to State”) but no data on gender. Additionally, the “Race/Ethnicity Groups” data included an “International/Nonresident” category that the majority of postdocs fit into, with no additional breakdown. Notably, it appears that “International/Nonresident” is mutually exclusive to “Underrepresented Minority” and “Not Underrepresented Minority”.\nThe Committee did not independently collect demographic data on the postdoc population at Stanford. We obtained these data directly from the Stanford IDEAL Dashboard website (https://ideal.stanford.edu/data-reports/ideal-dashboards). We appreciate that the IDEAL initiative has made these data publicly available and we also agree that the type of data collected could be substantially improved. For example, an additional option of “Intersex” could be added to the “Sex” question; an additional question for “Gender” could be added (with multiple inclusive response options); an additional question of “Country of Origin” or “Country of Citizenship” could be added; “Underrepresented Minority” could be clarified as “Underrepresented Minority Within the US”.\n\n\n\nOne anonymous commenter expressed dissatisfaction and impatience with the efforts of both the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs and SURPAS in addressing the challenges that postdocs at Stanford face. They raised the idea of postdoc unionization as a more effective path forward.\nThe SURPAS LRP Committee was not tasked with examining unionization of postdocs and we have not researched or investigated this potential path forward. However, we acknowledge that unionization is one way that postdocs could proceed with collective action in addressing some of the issues highlighted in this Report.\n\n\n\nFor many postdocs who responded to the Report, the aspects about the difficulty postdocs face meeting basic needs resonated deeply. In written comments and private conversations, postdocs shared with the Committee that reading about the widespread financial difficulties within the postdoctoral population covered in the Report made them feel less alone. When the Committee began the work of the Long Range Planning Report, we expected to focus on topics such as identifying and spreading best practices of mentorship or building community within the postdoctoral population. While these themes are present in the Report, a surprisingly large amount of the data we collected and analyzed dealt with postdocs struggling to meet basic needs. The current status quo of postdoctoral training and career progression is untenable for those with families or who do not come from backgrounds of economic privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis letter was composed by several postdoc leaders. The letter was adopted by the full SURPAS Council at the November 2022 meeting and sent to Dr. Stacey Bent, the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Postdoc Affairs and Dr. Sofie Kleppner, the Associate Vice Provost and Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs on December 7, 2022.\n–\n\n\nSupport for the under-represented minority and under-privileged postdoctoral community\nIntroduction\nPostdoctoral scholars are central to Stanford’s preeminence, making significant contributions to Stanford’s innovative and creative reputation. Postdocs fill integral roles in the teaching and research mission of the university. Postdocs work with faculty to formulate and conduct ground-breaking research, write grants, mentor students, publish papers, generate key data for NIH grants, and help lead research groups, as well as volunteer in programs to enrich the postdoc experience. Stanford aims to be an institution that supports postdocs, enabling them to realize their career ambitions and become leaders in the professions of their choosing. However, the reality is that the goals of most Stanford postdocs are often limited due to the challenges of trying to balance the pressures of research and the inability to afford basic human needs. Further, these challenges curtail the potential of some of the most skilled members of the postdoc community and inordinately affects those from traditionally underrepresented identities.\nDespite the irreplaceable work performed by postdocs, they are often not accounted for within the university hierarchy or afforded access to the same resources and structures as students, faculty, and/or staff. As a result, postdocs are excluded from programs aimed at helping these other groups; without formal cohorts or support networks, they are often isolated and deprived of a sense of community and belonging. This lack of support disproportionately impacts underrepresented minorities (URM) and other underprivileged current and future postdocs, who are excluded from Stanford through structural biases or bear the burden of the “diversity tax” with few external sources of support.\nBelow we outline key challenges faced by URM postdocs and potential solutions to ensure their successful training, enabling their transition into their desired career choice. These issues are in line with Stanford’s long-range vision and commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n–\n\n\nThe 2022-2023 minimum stipend for a Stanford postdoc is $68,238. While this is among the highest institution-wide minimums, due to the high local cost of living in the bay area, ~50% of postdocs live below the Santa Clara County area median income (published by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development as of April 1, 2021). As a result, ~36% of postdocs report experiencing food insecurity and ~10% have considered or will apply for government food stamps (based on SURPAS-led survey in December 2021).\nMany graduate students are considering industry jobs and those who want to pursue academia would prefer to go to institutions where they can afford to dedicate most of their time to research and less on trying to sustain a living.\nProgress\nStanford has made significant efforts by giving postdocs priority at the Oak Creek Apartments. However with only 25% discount, these apartments still remain out of the reach of most postdocs.\nStanford has also provided several grants to postdocs:\n\nFamily Grant (up to $10,000)\nChildcare Grant (up to $5000)\nBackup childcare\nEmergency grant-in-aid (up to $5000)\n\nStanford has also provided access to the GoPass for the Caltrain, making transportation easily accessible.\nRecommended Action\nHousing: Provide affordable (30% of post-tax income) housing on or near campus for postdocs such as below market rates to postdocs who apply to the Stanford-owned housing.\n\nOak Creek\nStanford West\nCardinals\nColonnades\n\nMoving costs: Stanford should provide moving costs up to $5000 to incoming postdocs who have demonstrated financial need for moving costs.\nEligibility criteria based on NIH standards:\nIndividuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are defined as those who meet two or more of the following criteria:\n\nWere homeless, as defined by the McKinney-Vento Definition of Homeless (this act can also be used as a guide for international postdocs).\nWere eligible for programs like the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program.\nHave no parents or legal guardians who completed a bachelor’s degree.\nReceived support from programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as a parent or child.\nGrew up in one of the following areas: a) a U.S. rural area, as designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Rural Health Grants Eligibility Analyzer, or b) a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-designated Low-Income and Health Professional Shortage Areas. International areas that fall under these categories should be considered.\n\nIntended Outcome\nStanford’s research mission is to foster discovery, creativity and innovation and this requires diverse perspectives and experiences which can only be achieved by bringing the best minds together to become part of the Stanford community.\nMaking Stanford more accessible will support recruitment and mitigate the upfront burden of moving costs, and help realize the promise of making Stanford truly inclusive and equitable.\n–\n\n\n\nProgress\nStanford has implemented the PRISM and PROPEL programs however, there is still a screening process by faculty which is subject to bias.\nRecommended Action\nProvide additional administrative support for the offices of Institutional Equity, Access & Community and for the School of Medicine office for Commission on Justice and Equity.\nDevelop 1:1 faculty (at all levels) mentoring and coaching programs (Duke University has implemented these programs) and implement best practices for hiring developed by the Committee on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging in the Stanford Department of Biology as part of the 1:1 training.\nProvide financial incentives for faculty to complete the annual individual development plan (IDP) with their postdocs.\nCollect data to quantify whether URMs and under-privileged postdocs are:\n\nnot applying for postdocs at Stanford,\nnot getting interviews,\nnot getting offers, or\ngetting offers and choosing not to come\nleaving Stanford early.\n\nHave faculty submit open positions to the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA).\nOPA should advertise positions more widely and in HBCUs by establishing a diversity recruitment committee, similar to the Graduate Medical Education diversity recruitment program.\nEncourage faculty to work with the new Director of HBCU Partnerships and Engagement, Dr. Judith Ned.\nIntended Outcome\nThese efforts will increase diversity and achieve the goal of equity and inclusion at Stanford.\nThe 1:1 mentoring and coaching programs and financial incentives will also allow faculty to glimpse the backgrounds of their postdocs, inspire understanding and be more invested in the success of their postdocs.\nThe data collected on URM and under-privileged postdocs will inform on how best to increase diversity at Stanford.\n–\n\n\n\nURM postdocs do much of the work advancing diversity and inclusion and are expected to be as scientifically productive as their colleagues without DEI concerns/efforts and deserve compensation for this work as well.\nRecommended Action\nHire dedicated staff to help with the programs implemented for creating community and sense of belonging for URM postdocs to alleviate the diversity tax burden on URM postdocs. Examples of current programs include:\n\nSomeone Like Me (postdoc and graduate student mentoring)\nSomeone Like Me (faculty and postdoc mentoring)\nBetter Ally\nJust Like You\nPro\n\nEnsure that postdocs who serve on DEI committees are compensated. One possibility is to have a University-wide DEI fund that departments (or even the committees directly) can apply for to compensate for service.\nIntended Outcome\nThese efforts will reduce the burden of the “diversity tax” on URM postdocs.\nDedicated staff will help create a mechanism for postdoc groups to work with existing department administrators and would expand the reach and impact of URM groups.\nThe financial compensation goes a long way to recognize the hard work being done by those engaged in DEI and will provide encouragement to continue to engage in these activities.\n–\n\n\n\nThe issues that postdocs face, such as the pressures of their research and being productive, evidenced by publications and obtaining grants, the uncertainty of being able to attain their preferred career trajectory, are compounded by financial stress, lack of feeling included and equal to their non-URM colleagues at Stanford, and bias and discriminatory experiences, creates a significant amount of mental stress. This is compounded by the lack of diverse therapists and mental health workers at Stanford.\nProgress\nStanford has taken measures to institute Meru, a free mental health program for postdocs.\nRecommended Action\nEstablish a resource (see UCSF program) to mediate relationships between mentor and mentee - formally requesting a meeting between the faculty member, postdoc and an objective mediator to facilitate a positive resolution. This provision should be made available for all postdocs.\nActively provide support for postdocs who have reported bias, discrimination and/or microaggressions such as follow-up meetings with the postdoc and faculty mentor to ensure that a successful resolution has been achieved.\nProvide diverse and accessible mental health and wellness therapists. Meru does not include face-to-face interactions with the therapist and the program does not guarantee requests for a therapist with a specific background or identity which is important for mental health.\nIntended Outcome This will instill confidence that the University cares about these issues and provide a sense of belonging to the postdoc while at the same time educating the faculty member who may or may not realize the implications of their actions and will have the opportunity to listen and learn from the perspectives of their postdoc.\nHelping the minority populations by providing mental health resources will help the larger Stanford population.\n–\n\n\n\n\nStanford postdocs are represented by people from diverse backgrounds. The achievement of this diverse community, however, comes at a great cost, especially to those that do not come from privileged financial backgrounds. Addressing these issues, which are key to the success of postdocs, is a great opportunity for Stanford to demonstrate its commitment to equity, inclusivity, and diversity.\nSincerely,\nStanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS)\nChinyere Iweka and Julia Abitbol (SURPAS Co-Chairs)\nSeungsoo Kim and Michael Lawson (SURPAS JEDI committee co-chairs)\nAravind Natarajan (Postdoc representative to the Stanford SOM DEI Cabinet)\nAzeezat Azeez (former SBPA co-chair)\nSigned by the following groups in solidarity:\nStanford Latinx Postdoctoral Association (SLPA)\nStanford LGBTQ+ Postdoctoral Association\nStanford Black Postdoctoral Association (SBPA)\nStanford Chinese Postdoctoral Association (SCPA)\n–\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing is the main component of cost of living: ~47% of postdocs spend >$2000/month on housing. Furthermore, 25.3% of postdocs share housing with roommates, however, this is not an option for all postdocs (e.g. those with families). Many Stanford postdocs cannot afford to live near campus due to high rents and childcare costs, and some live as far as San Jose, Santa Cruz and the East Bay. Cost is a major factor for many top URM candidates who decide to pursue their training elsewhere (based on discussions with candidates from the PRISM program; no data on declined postdoc offers exist). The high cost of rent, plus moving costs and security deposit, is particularly burdensome in the first weeks of a postdoc position, before the first stipend payment. Indeed, a recent survey administered by the Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association (SLPA) showed that ~66% of incoming Latinx postdocs spend >$3000 on moving costs alone.\nStanford has taken steps to mitigate housing issues for postdocs, including temporarily opening graduate housing to postdocs by lottery during the COVID-19 pandemic, a pilot program to offer transitional housing for incoming postdocs, and the first priority now being given to postdocs at the newly acquired Oak Creek Apartments (but at 25% discounted rate, housing will still be a challenge for low-income background postdocs). However, due to the high enrollment of undergraduate students for the 2022/23 academic year, the lottery system is no longer available to postdocs - they were asked to vacate all student housing by August 14th, 2022, less than a month’s notice of the lottery being discontinued. Even while open, graduate housing was competitive as postdocs were last priority, and even those who did obtain housing faced the uncertainty of having to move or losing it each year if they were not selected in the annual lottery. This instability was particularly challenging for postdocs with disabilities and with children. In this manner, Stanford perpetuates systemic inequity and continues to remain an exclusive institution for the privileged.\n\n\n\nURM postdocs make up only 6% of the Stanford postdoc population–in contrast to over 30% of Stanford undergraduates and 15% of Stanford graduate students (~27% graduate students in basic sciences; IDEAL 2021-22). One particular limitation to increasing diversity among postdocs is the decentralized nature of postdoc hiring. The first step of postdoc hiring is typically an unsolicited email to a faculty member, at least in biomedical sciences. Usually, this is the most selective and potentially biased part of the process, as many faculty cannot carefully consider all emails and instead screen for factors such as PhD training in well-known institutions or labs (where URMs are often especially underrepresented). Furthermore, the lack of data on postdoc hiring makes it impossible to determine the extent of bias in this and other stages of postdoc hiring.\nThe University has taken important steps to increase diversity within the postdoc community, namely the PRISM-Baker program. This program aims to support URM postdoc candidates, from funding the travel costs of interviewing, through one or more years of postdoc funding and community-building. However, candidates are prescreened by faculty and the aforementioned biases limit the pool of URM postdoc candidates.\nMany URM considering a postdoc at Stanford are faced with added financial burdens and thus may often choose not to pursue a postdoc at all. While Stanford does offer support to those in financial need (through emergency grants and has recently expanded support for those with children by raising the maximum family grant to $10,000/year, as well as the childcare grant), this funding may not be known to potential candidates and applying also comes with the burden and stigma of applying and justifying need. Moreover, funding does not support those with obligations to support parents or other relatives who are not legally dependents.\n\n\n\nPostdocs lack formal cohorts and other structures provided by PhD programs, and many are the only or one of few postdocs in their lab. SURPAS, postdoc affinity groups, and other cross-disciplinary postdoc communities aim to address this need. However, these groups face challenges reaching the often isolated postdocs whose only initial and regular contacts are with their advisor and department administrators. While Stanford (Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA) and Vice Provost of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs (VPGEPA)) support these groups financially, administrative support is minimal. Thus, the time-intensive burden of organizing and running these groups falls on postdocs, particularly URMs, who “feel a professional and personal burden of having to do diversity and inclusion work without recognition or reward, something they refer to as the ‘diversity tax.’”\nURM postdocs that work to provide a community are already overwhelmed with their research responsibilities, professional development training on top of the effort to fit in. This community-building work is usually uncompensated and also contributes to the perception that community-building work is a distraction from their training and research. The OPA recently instituted an annual JEDI recognition award during the National Postdoctoral JEDI awards, and while this is a step in the right direction, it does not protect time spent by URM postdocs doing JEDI work.\n\n\n\nMany URM postdocs report experiencing acts of bias or discrimination (IDEAL survey), often perpetrated by faculty members, including their own advisor. The unique power of advisors over their postdocs makes the threat of retaliation overwhelming. Currently, postdocs can seek anonymous counseling via the Ombuds offices and take formal action via the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Yet, a clear reporting structure does not exist and postdocs lack knowledge about their resources. Moreover, there are rarely repercussions against the perpetrator, increasing the fear of retaliation and disempowering postdocs. Providing a safe environment for URM postdocs–including international postdocs who refrain from reporting due to visa concerns–should be a priority for the University. Clear protocols for bias and discrimination reporting, including mediation efforts and updates on repercussions between affected parties should be developed.\n\n\n\nIncreased URM faculty presence instills confidence in URM postdocs and potential formal or informal mentors. While the number of female faculty at Stanford rose from 22% to 32% and Asian faculty increased from 10% to 19%, the number of URM faculty members has remained fairly stagnant, increasing from 6% to 7.2% in 20 years. Between 2016 and 2020, URM faculty in the School of Medicine has increased only by 0.8%, exhibiting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of only 0.1% while total faculty CAGR is 6.8%. Stanford recently hired a very small number of URM faculty, however, this was loosely based on their research of the URM faculty to include or relate to diversity topics. Hence there still remains little increase in URM faculty whose research is based on clinical or basic science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, the Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association conducted a survey of postdocs on moving & living expenses. The data and analysis were made publicly available at the following website: https://slpa.github.io/survey2022/. The survey was completed by 212 anonymous postdocs, of which 55 identified as Latinx. The survey questionnaire was designed by Julieta Álvarez Manjarrez with input from the SLPA board members Clare Abreu, Sur Herrera Paredes, Renato S. Navarro, Fátima Pardo Ávila, Maria-Belen Perez-Ramirez, and Vanessa Sanchez with report and analysis prepared by Clare Abreu, Sur Herrera Paredes, and Fátima Pardo Ávila with input from Stepfanie Aguillon and Julieta Álvarez Manharrez. SURPAS leadership and Communications Director Geetha Saarunya Clarke helped disseminate the survey. We highly encourage interested readers to peruse the data and analysis at the link above. The summary of major findings from the report and a copy of the open letter with more than 150 signatories are included below. The major ask from SLPA was for the creation of a need-based $5,000 relocation grant for all incoming postdocs.\n–\n\n\n\nWe present the results from the largest ever survey of the Stanford Latinx postdocs, sampling more than 40% of the whole Latinx postdoc community.\nThe median postdoc had a monthly salary of $1,701-$2,500 prior to Stanford, and they spent a median of $3,000-$4,000 in their first month for housing and around $2,000 in moving costs other than housing when moving to Stanford.\nLatinx postdocs are a diverse population. When compared with non-Latinx postdocs, we see that Latinx postdocs move to Stanford from a greater number of distinct regions, and had more variable salaries prior to Stanford.\nWhen compared with the most recent SURPAS benefits survey (conducted in December 2021 - January 2022), we detected increases in expenses related to housing, car transportation, and food. These increases track with known global, national, and regional trends and are likely driven by inflation, and have outpaced minimum salary increases.\nLatinx postdocs are disproportionately affected in housing costs, living distance to campus, car transportation costs, financial concerns, and retirement savings. In aggregate, these differences point to a troubling trend.\nOverall, postdocs are dissatisfied with their financial situation, with majorities indicating that their salary doesn’t cover their living expenses, and that this has negative impacts in multiple aspects of their lives. We found other factors to have much weaker, if any effects.\nIn their responses to an open ended question, postdoc comments indicated overwhelming frustration and negative emotions. Many postdocs highlighted financial struggles, and the negative consequences on their mental and physical health.\n\n\n\n\nTo the Stanford community:\n“Increasing the diversity of the faculty, especially faculty from underrepresented backgrounds including racial and ethnic minorities and women in STEM” was the top challenge identified by the 2021 Provost’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusion. Postdoctoral scholars represent the crucial link between Stanford’s highly diverse student body and its less diverse faculty. As the Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association (SLPA), we are committed to help Stanford rise to this challenge and to identify the barriers faced by our community to advancing their academic careers. Our newly released postdoc moving and living expenses survey reveals a disturbing picture of Stanford postdocs struggling to cover basic expenses, with Latinx postdocs disproportionately affected by monthly costs, living distance to campus, and financial stress. In particular, the cost of moving to the Bay Area is the first barrier that potential postdocs face when considering Stanford. Here, the signatories propose the creation of a need-based relocation grant open to all incoming postdocs.\nThe struggle to afford basic expenses is taking a toll on postdocs’ mental and physical health, inhibiting academic progress and causing some to leave academia. A majority of postdocs report that their salary does not cover their living expenses, and for many, completing a postdoc at Stanford is feasible only with a partner’s salary and/or without having children. SLPA fully supports the efforts of our colleagues across the many active postdoc organizations at Stanford (SURPAS and its committees, the Stanford Black Postdoc Association, the Stanford LGBTQ+ Postdocs, and the Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association) to improve affordability and overall well-being for Stanford postdocs.\nImportantly, the sheer difficulty of arriving at Stanford means that our community is the product of survivor bias: how many talented scientists couldn’t afford to come to Stanford? The challenges for incoming postdocs begin before reaching Stanford; the costs of relocating cause postdocs to deplete savings and incur debt. These burdens can last long after beginning a postdoc appointment. Our survey shows that Latinx postdocs, in particular those moving from Latin America, spend less in their first month at Stanford, while at the same time they are more likely to ask for a loan to relocate. This means that they are stretching their financial possibilities to the limit, which comes at the expense of living farther away or in precarious conditions. It is important to point out that moving from Latin America is an easy proxy for prior low income, but other historically marginalized groups, such as Black, Native American or first generation college graduates, are likely to face similar or even greater burdens.\nIn order to fulfill Stanford’s commitment to diversifying academia, it is imperative to address the high barrier to entry for Latinx and other historically marginalized scientists. As a first step, SLPA and the signatories propose the creation of a need-based $5,000 USD relocation grant open to all incoming postdocs. This grant would cover moving expenses, and the first month of housing, transportation, childcare and miscellaneous expenses. All incoming postdocs would be eligible, and priority should be given to those moving from low and middle income countries, postdocs with dependents, and postdocs from historically marginalized backgrounds.\nWe are convinced that in order to diversify academia we must tear down the unjust barriers that limit the potential of countless postdocs. We ask that postdocs are no longer required to sacrifice their well-being in order to be able to be part of the Stanford community. Our university has the material and human resources necessary to create an inclusive and equitable environment, where opportunities and success are determined only by the dreams of each person, and not by their historical realities. We are hopeful that the administration, faculty, student body and the Stanford community at large are committed to overthrowing these barriers. We are certain that together we will make Stanford the model of a just, equitable, diverse and inclusive community.\nIn solidarity,\nStanford Latinx Postdoc Association\nSigned by the following groups:\nStanford Chinese Postdoctoral Association (SCPA)\nStanford LGBTQ+ Postdocs\nStanford Black Postdoc Association (SBPA)\nStanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis letter was written and circulated by the Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association in response to the University’s acquisition1 of Oak Creek Apartments for postdocs, with more than 150 postdocs signing in a period lasting fewer than two weeks. When the housing became available, postdocs would have only 24 hours to respond when they were taken off the waiting list. At the SURPAS Council meeting on February 22, 2023, a Council member shared a story from a postdoc who was taken off the waiting list but was told they did not qualify for housing because their income (the university minimum) was below the minimum threshold for affordability.\n–\nTo whom it may concern,\nWe are postdocs from diverse departments at Stanford. We are writing this letter to express our deep concerns about postdocs’ housing situations.\nIn September, we were very excited and grateful that the university has acquired hundreds of units in Oak Creek, which is expected to alleviate the rising housing cost for postdocs. However, the rental rates are $2,345~$3,356 for 1B and $3,016~$4,003 for 2B, excluding costs for sewage, water, electricity, and internet.\nThese are unreasonable and unaffordable rental rates for us postdocs. First of all, the price does not conform with the early claim that “Rental rates for eligible Stanford-affiliated tenants at Oak Creek will be less than the market rate”. They are only negligibly lower than the market rate in Palo Alto (which is no longer true, if taking into consideration that sewage and water are included in the rental fees for many apartments on the market, as well as Stanford housing); however, still 40%-50% higher than Stanford Housing. Second, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), people who spend more than 30% of their income on housing are defined as housing-cost burdened. Our monthly income excluding tax ranges between $4200-$5000 (most of us are at the lower end). Hence, this rental-to-income ratio is astonishingly 60%-80% for most Stanford postdocs. Even worse, for many of us, our stipend/salary is the only source of income for our family, and as we are international students, the gap is even larger. Not to mention that a large number of postdocs have one or more than one kid, which has long put their family in budget deficits (we appreciate the university’s great support of Family/Child Grant Funding, but it is still a drop in the bucket). It is impossible for us to afford this high rental fee while maintaining the normal run of a family. As a whole, these high rental rates are devastating to us.\nConsequently, although we now seem to have more on-campus housing options, we cannot afford them at all. This will in no way help resolve our enormous difficulty in housing, which we believe goes against the goodwill of Stanford’s action to acquire this property.\nWe also would like to express our serious concerns that the rising living cost has threatened our work efficiency and willingness to stay in academia. Worries about finding an affordable living place have put our family and us in great anxiety. Many of us are being or have already been forced to decide to leave and join the industry because our limited salary combined with the high rental fee has threatened our basic living.\nWe appreciate your attention to this urgent matter and kindly ask for your help.\n\n\n\n\nThis survey effort was spearheaded by the SURPAS Leadership Team, including Co-Chairs Chinyere Iweka and Chuchu Wang.\nThe Benefits and Affordability Survey was designed and administered by SURPAS in response to testimonials from postdocs regarding continued affordability struggles, especially after increases to health care costs were implemented. The survey ran for 1 month (December 2021). We received 316 responses, which is a 13% response rate based on the total population of postdocs at Stanford.\n–\n\n\nDemographic information indicates that the sample is representative of the current postdoc population at Stanford:\n\nMost postdocs are in their early 30s.\nMost survey respondents are in the first 3 years of their postdoc.\nRespondent school distribution is similar to postdoc population (majority SOM).\nRespondent citizenship status is similar to postdoc population (majority is international).\nOther demographic considerations: 4.7% of responders identified as disabled or having a disability 20% of responders identified as having low socioeconomic status 31% of responders identified as First Gen college students\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoc salaries are low.\n\n83% of postdocs earn less than $72k/year.\nWhen total household income is taken into account, 50% of postdocs live below the SCC poverty line ($82,450).\n\nHousing affordability is a major issue facing postdocs and impacts decisions of where to live and how far.\n\n88% of postdocs list cost and proximity to campus as major reason for wanting on-campus housing.\n~47% of postdocs live >5 miles from campus and spend >30 minutes/day on their commute.\n\nLow salaries and high housing costs make food and health care costs a big burden, specifically for postdocs with families.\n\n36% of postdocs suffer from food insecurity.\n27% of postdocs on the SHCA plan report being significantly impacted financially by recent increase in healthcare premiums.\n\n\nFinancial Aid grants are awarded to 90% of applicants. However, only ~50% of postdocs are aware that they exist and only ~25% have ever applied for them. Of the 25% that apply, 35% applied for multiple grants, suggesting that an individual grant is insufficient (or was, before the increase in amount).\nOverall these results suggest that the postdoc salary (after taxes) is incompatible with the Bay Area living costs. The strain to cover all costs is high, especially for postdocs with families. The financial aid grants that have been awarded are a great place to start to address this issue. However, they only meet the needs of those that apply and are awarded them. Below are some recommendations that might benefit postdocs more broadly.\n\n\n\n\nSalary increase to $85,000 (slightly above $82,450 SCC poverty line and will make a difference).\n\nWe are aware that this may be a burden on the Faculty. The reality is that it is difficult to survive with our current salary. We wonder if there is a way to find a middle ground? Such as provide more benefits and cut the costs for postdocs.\n\nAllocating some housing units in Escondido Village for postdocs.\nUse graduate student housing units that become available once graduate students move to Escondido Village as subsidized housing for postdocs.\nMake Stanford-owned housing available at Below Market Rate for postdocs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis letter was written by the SURPAS Family Committee in response to the increase in health insurance premiums for postdocs with dependents in 2021. Over 300 community members, including postdocs, graduate students, faculty, and staff, signed the letter. It is addressed to Dr. Stacey Bent, the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Postdoc Affairs, and Dr. Sofie Kleppner, the Associate Vice Provost and Associate Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs. As a result of postdocs objecting to the sudden increases in rates and beginning to draft this letter, the planned insurance increases were phased in via four installments over the course of the year rather than in a single increase, with costs covered by subsidies. After postdocs sent this letter, the university created a Family Grant of up to $5,000 for postdocs (now up to $10,000).\n–\n\n\nNovember 5, 2020\nDear Dr. Stacey Bent & Dr. Sofie Kleppner,\nAs representatives of Stanford Postdocs, we are writing this letter in regard to the recent changes to the healthcare coverage for Stanford Postdocs, particularly for Postdocs with dependents. According to the recently released 2021 Health Plan premium rates, the monthly cost for a Postdoc to cover their children or their entire family through SHCA will increase by 61%, while the cost to cover a partner will increase by 28%. While we certainly appreciate the subsidies that are being offered to help alleviate some of the initial burden, these subsidies only provide temporary relief and are not long-term solutions. We understand that the cost of these benefit packages fluctuates over time, however, we believe that the most recent changes and their associated costs place an unfair burden on Postdocs with dependents. Our concerns are as follows:\n\nPostdocs with dependents represent an economically disadvantaged population on campus. This recent increase will cause a further reduction to their already limited funds, with up to 10% of their take-home income dedicated to health care coverage, and this is before any additional co-pays and other costs are included.\nThis burden is disproportionately places on Postdocs with dependents, especially international Postdocs who have visa limitations for spouse/partner contributions, single income families in which the partner/spouse provides childcare, and families without access to generational wealth to offset the cost of living.\nPostdocs now only have a single option for benefits while Faculty and Staff have multiple options, most of which are cheaper than SHCA.\nTo our knowledge, these negotiations took place months ago without request for feedback or input from the individuals that were being most affected by these changes.\nPostdocs have no security going forward regarding how much of their limited income is dedicated to healthcare costs.\n\nGiven the issue at hand and having full confidence that your offices care deeply about the well-being of Postdocs, we would like to propose that you help us achieve the following:\n\nThat the institutional subsidies be maintained to cover the same fraction of total health plan cost as in 2020. For example, under the 2020 contribution rates, Stanford paid approximately 90% of the total SHCA cost for postdocs with covered families, whereas under the 2021 rates, Stanford’s contribution will drop to 85% of the total cost.\nThat Postdocs, especially those with dependents, as well as Graduate students, who have also experienced equity issues surrounding their health care costs, be represented in negotiations and informed of potential changes to their healthcare packages before Stanford approval for such changes.\nThat equity working groups ensure that undue financial burdens are not disproportionately placed on Postdocs and Graduate Students in the future, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds and with dependents.\n\nFailure to act on this will impose the great financial burden on Postdocs with dependents that has been mentioned above, will go against Stanford’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts, and will reinforce the statement that Postdocs cannot afford to have children during this stage of their life.\nWe look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this.\nSincerely,\nJohn Hegarty, Max Turner, and Arianna Celis on behalf of\nThe Stanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS) Family Committee\n–\n\n\n\nSome signers provided comments, a selection of which (edited for anonymity) are included below:\n\nAs if we do not have enough financial struggle in our lives and as if everyone is not unusually stressed due to the pandemic, now we need to pay more for healthcare. These days, we hear these a lot: “be gentle to yourself”, “take good care of yourself”, “support each other”. Then, some people are trying to charge us more for something which has never been this vital. This is an exploitation of the pandemic.\n\n\nCost of living is already high and I think it is important to take into account the burden this increase will have on families even if the increase is delayed. For me personally with 3 children to support by myself, an increase of as little as $20 a month is a significant burden.\n\n\nDental and vision are not included for dependents and need to pay high cost for these treatments for dependents.\n\n\nGraduate students would be excited to unite on this issue. Health care a month for dependents is outrageous for us too.\n\n\nHow could dependent parents be included in postdoc healthcare plans? At about the same rates as spouses? As postdocs, we often have aged parents who need care and financially depend on us for healthcare.\n\n\nI am actively considering leaving a promising academic track career because I cannot figure out how to afford kids on a postdoc salary in the Bay Area. We cannot hope to support diversity and inclusion at Stanford while simultaneously making it harder for those with families to afford being here.\n\n\nI am getting married soon, and this puts additional financial burden on me.\n\n\nI am thinking of changing my insurance provider since not only is it very expensive, but it also does not cover the needs that my family has, like orthodontics for my children. One of them needs them because of functional, not aesthetic, purposes. It is a shame that with all the uncertainties and stresses that postdoctoral life has, we also need to be losing our sleep about health care insurance cost and coverage.\n\n\nI am very unhappy that these material changes are made with no discussion with the faculty and the postdocs themselves. This is not a way to treat our Stanford community.\n\n\nI currently live out of the service area to be included in Stanford Alliance coverage so I also have the added cost of Aetna Choice for my dependents and I.\n\n\nImagine how much a postdoc would be paying for housing and health benefits if he is a father of a baby and a husband of a housewife. Stanford should treat their postdoc either as students or employees. Currently, postdocs seem to be categorized as whichever comes with less benefit on a case by case basis (retirement, housing, transportation, you name it), which has been extremely frustrating… Stanford should state this fact very clearly on their benefit page before people decide to join the Stanford family such that they are aware of how much Stanford are valuing their postdocs and how much the living cost is in the bay area.\n\n\nIt is deeply ironic and very sad to see Stanford putting effort into “wellness” and simultaneously increasing healthcare premiums for postdocs, particularly those with families, many of whom are living month to month on their extremely low salary for the area cost of living. It is time for Stanford University, and the office of postdoctoral affairs, to put its money where its mouth is. No amount of “wellness” initiatives can ameliorate the extreme financial stress of the postdoc salary, and no amount of diversity and inclusivity initiatives can ameliorate the unequal burden that increased premiums place on postdocs with families who have taken non-traditional career paths due to their background. Postdoctoral salaries here are already despicable and make it very difficult to recruit talent; this is a step very much in the wrong direction. We will not tolerate this treatment silently.\n\n\nIt is unconscionable that Stanford is pushing increased costs due to the pandemic on some of the most economically vulnerable members of our community.\n\n\nIt is very difficult for me to even be able to afford insurance for my significant other, who has supported my career, on my current salary. It is actually close to impossible to afford housing and also medical insurance for the both of us.\n\n\nPlease reconsider the huge increase of insurance premium. Stanford is already known for being a place hard to live in because of the most expensive living cost in the US for postdocs with dependents. On top of that, the 61% increase would overwhelm most of a postdoc’s life in Stanford. Eventually, this situation potentially makes Stanford be not a charming place to live for prospective researchers.\n\n\nPlease reduce the financial burden on our Postdocs with families. It’s huge money to be paid along with rental charges and supporting family expenses.\n\n\nPostdocs are already financially strained to their limits, in particular those with family. Any further burden is unacceptable.\n\n\nPostdocs are the foundation of academic research and we deserve to be paid fair compensation and benefits.\n\n\nPostdocs did not have financial means to support a family in the bay area. You are increasing the premiums of a very valnourable [sic] group of people who conduct the most important purpose of the institute; research. Besides unilaterally putting an addition financial burden on only postdoc with families is a clear discrimination postdoc with families.\n\n\nScience at Stanford is eroding because we cannot get the best people to come because they cannot afford to live here. Stanford has done far less to address this issue compared to several comparable institutions.\n\n\nStanford must do a better job supporting its postdocs, and affordable health care in the middle of a pandemic should be number 1 priority.\n\n\nThis is outrageous. Stanford claims it’s an equal-opportunity employer. By making it completely unaffordable for employees with family to keep health insurance, you are directly discriminating against workers who are not single or already face higher health care costs. So much for equal opportunity.\n\n\nTransparency is key. When major changes happen with anything, those affected should be notified. This is important so that their voices can be heard and contingency plans can be made."

    "text": "Postdocs at Stanford have been advocating for improved conditions for themselves since at least 1998 when the Stanford postdoctoral association, SURPAS, was founded (see Appendix A: SURPAS (Stanford Postdoc Association) Bylaws). The Committee engaged with past advocacy efforts of postdocs at Stanford by reviewing and synthesizing information from SURPAS’ records, as detailed in this section of the Report.\nOur community represents one unique stakeholder group within the University that shares common issues with many other stakeholder groups. While this Long Range Planning process is focused on the postdoc perspective, we also recognize the need for solidarity and support with other University communities, such as graduate students, medical residents, custodial staff, and kitchen workers. As an example of common issues between stakeholders, postdocs at Stanford faced increases in costs for dependent health insurance at the same time as service workers on campus (see SURPAS Family Committee Letter (2020/21)).1\n\n\nThe Committee assessed previous work performed by postdoc organizers. We accessed documents on major advocacy efforts throughout the years that had been collected and stored by SURPAS Leadership. Each of these individual resources was read and analyzed by two Committee members to ensure a diversity of viewpoints. Committee members wrote a three-sentence summary of the “acute needs” of postdocs that they identified within the resource and a separate three-sentence summary of any “long-term ideas” identified. Collective analysis of these resources by the Committee led to the themes and ideas presented in this section of the Report. Most resources addressed multiple themes.\nThe five core themes that emerged through our review of past work were:\n\nMentoring\nAffordability\nStatus\nJustice, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging\nImplementation & Outreach\n\nEach theme is expanded upon in the headings below. All include “Key points to consider” and “Areas for action”.\n\n\n\n(Listed in reverse chronological order.)\n\n“Opinion: Letter to the President and Provost: Action Items for Achieving Racial Equity”, (Jun 19, 2020).

During the postdoctoral training period, a researcher can develop new technical skills, learn about problems in new fields, and seek out career development opportunities. On the other hand, postdocs fulfill an important role in providing mentorship, often serving as a first point of contact and important player in the education of graduate students. Though these mentorship experiences are important for postdocs to develop mentorship capabilities, they are rarely formally recognized. Furthermore, there do not exist professional training or certification processes by which postdocs can seek mentorship training as a career development option. The lack of mentorship training programs for postdocs creates a pool of faculty candidates who have not had formalized mentorship training, perpetuating the issue.\n\n\n\nAwareness of the importance of mentoring should be increased both for the professor and also among postdocs. Mentorship training for both postdocs and principal investigators is generally non-existent or poorly adopted.\nMany postdocs are very grateful for scientific environment at Stanford but feel a lack of support in other areas: insufficient career development options, lack of encouragement for pursuit of non-laboratory opportunities (e.g. career development or teaching), difficulty interacting with faculty members outside of primary research advisor, and most especially monetary compensation. Many people plan on leaving academia because they do not have financial support, with some going into debt to work as a postdoc with the high cost of living.\nActive participation by postdocs in laboratory discussion is an important part of the mentorship and education PhD students receive during graduate school. Postdocs provide hands-on instruction in the laboratory, give professional and academic feedback, model how an academic career may look for the graduate student, and provide personal/emotional support.\nPostdocs led the creation of the “Someone Like Me” Mentoring program to provide support for trainees with marginalized backgrounds.2\nPostdocs are required to schedule an Individual Development Plan (IDP) meeting at least yearly with their advisor to discuss career progression. In many cases these meetings rarely occur or are poorly implemented. The onus for scheduling and reporting the meeting is placed on postdocs with no incentive or consequence for PIs engaging with the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nA solid mentorship program for postdocs should be developed. Such a program would need to emphasize the need for the postdoc to receive mentorship and also to practice mentoring younger scientists. A two-day Mentoring in Research workshop,3 which used to be run quarterly, has not been offered since early 2020. Reimplementation of this mentorship workshop is a first step.\nSearching for successful mentoring examples and identifying best practices would be a great benchmark to build the curriculum for these mentoring courses.\nThe Postdoc Teaching Certificate is offered as a professional certification for postdocs preparing to be a lecturer/tenure-track faculty member.4 Creation of an analogous certificate for mentoring would be important to provide postdocs hands-on skill in mentoring younger scientists. Mentorship training would be of value for postdocs hoping to become a principal investigator in their own academic lab and for postdocs transitioning to industry.\nPostdocs should have the opportunity to receive mentorship from multiple professors beyond their primary faculty advisor, either through formal or informal mentorship structures. Incentives that compensate faculty for their time would be required to get buy-in from the mentors. Current incentive structures do not reward faculty for mentorship.5\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford is one of the wealthiest institutions in the world and is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, where cost of living far outstrips the modest salary postdocs receive. As a result, postdocs at Stanford suffer from food insecurity and rely on the pop-up food pantry run by Second Harvest Food Bank and initially organized by the Stanford Solidarity Network.6 With waitlists for childcare opportunities on campus often lasting longer than some postdoc’s appointments, many postdoctoral scholars with families do not bother applying and are forced to shoulder the costs themselves. The February 2021 announcement of a $5,000 family grant (now up to $10,000) is much appreciated but does not sufficiently cover the costs of childcare.7 These affordability issues raise the barrier to an academic career for those with families and people from disadvantaged economic backgrounds.\n\n\n\nWith a minimum salary of $68,238 as of September 1, 2022,8 postdocs make far lower than the median income in Santa Clara County ($117,900 for a single person household). A single postdoc is classified as “Low Income”; a two-person household relying solely on a postdoc salary (as is the case for international postdocs with a spouse who is not allowed to work in the US) hovers barely above the “Very Low Income” category; while a three-person household is thousands of dollars short of the line separating “Low Income” from “Very Low Income” (as defined by the CA Department of Housing and Urban Development).9\nIn 2020-2021, a sudden change in the postdoc health insurance plan caused a spike in premium costs of over 60% for postdocs with dependents. Meanwhile, postdocs with no dependents saw no change in insurance costs.\nPaid parental leave policies vary from department to department (or even from Principal Investigator to Principal Investigator). While some departments at Stanford and many prestigious postdoctoral fellowships offer paid leave for 12 weeks, this policy is patchwork across the university.\nFor retirement savings, postdocs (who are being paid a salary through Stanford, but not necessarily those on fellowship funding) have access to a Tax-Deferred Account and a Roth 403(b) Account. However, there is zero matched contribution from Stanford towards any postdoc retirement savings. By contrast, as of November 2022, Stanford “benefits-eligible employees” (not postdocs) begin to receive matched contributions after one year of service which increases thereafter. (see also next section, “3. Status”)\n\n\n\n\n\nEliminate food insecurity among Stanford’s research population by increasing postdoc salaries. Postdocs should also be able to access affordable housing (defined as paying no more than one-third of take-home income on rent). Salaries must take into account the cost of living and the housing market in the local area.\nEnsure equity in fee changes such that postdocs who are already economically vulnerable do not disproportionately bear the burden (e.g. postdoc parents with healthcare costs).\nInstitute a standardized 12-week minimum paid leave for all postdoc parents.\nOffer affordable childcare to postdocs with dependents.\nMatched contributions for postdoc retirement accounts.\nTarget fundraising and allocate money from the Stanford Endowment Income Funds Pool (“EIFP”) and the Expendable Funds Pool (“EFP”) to assist in the creation of an endowed fund specifically for postdocs to provide funding for initiatives like matched retirement contributions, increased salaries, and defraying the cost of childcare.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoc status impacts both how Postdocs are perceived by themselves and others in the Stanford community, as well as more concrete issues such as access to resources and benefits. Postdocs are currently defined as ‘non-matriculated, non-degree seeking students’. However, because many Postdocs also receive W2 forms and do not pay student fees, the financial systems at Stanford (e.g. payroll, ASSU) view Postdocs as closer to employees. Though there are multiple organized postdoc groups beyond SURPAS, none are officially recognized by the university; the non-matriculated status of postdocs prevents us from accessing many benefits available to students.\n\n\n\nSchool of Medicine and several other departments now recognise Postdocs as alumni with access to alumni networks. However, the Stanford Alumni Association only allows postdocs to have an Affiliate Membership which has reduced benefits compared to full membership.\nAs of 2022 Postdocs have priority access to housing near campus. However, units are limited in number and costs make postdocs severely rent burdened (see Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association Housing Costs Letter in Ongoing Stanford Postdoc Advocacy section of the Report).\nSome postdocs have student loan debt and the classification as ‘non-matriculated students’ allows postdocs to defer payments during their training period. Many postdocs feel that after receiving a terminal degree they should be able to afford student loan payments without worry or need to defer, something that is unattainable on a current postdoc salary.\nThe term student does not recognise that Postdocs have already completed several years of training and hold terminal degrees in their fields. Postdocs additionally contribute to mentoring, teaching, research, and maintenance within their lab spaces.\nThere is a lack of clarity over employee rights/benefits that Postdocs are entitled to, e.g. matched retirement contributions, workers compensation rights.\nMany postdocs transition to senior scientist or instructor roles after timing out of their postdoctoral position. In these situations, job duties remain largely unchanged while the postdoc becomes officially classified as an employee.\nThe lack of clarity with regards to postdoc status leads to postdocs being left out of university initiatives. In 2021, the Community Board on Public Safety sought input from Stanford community members in a pair of meetings. A meeting for faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and staff was held March 26. A meeting for students was held on April 12. There were no attempts by University administration to inform postdocs of the existence of these meetings (e.g. through presentation at a SURPAS Council meeting or emailing the postdoc listserv). Postdocs only learned of the call for input after the March 26 meeting had already passed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of classification as students or employees, postdocs should be paid salaries commensurate with our status as holders of terminal degrees. Compensation should be high enough that postdocs can afford life expenses such as student loan payments, saving for retirement, or childcare expenses.\nPostdocs should receive matched contributions to retirement accounts comparable with staff compensation. In the interim while such a program is rolled out, all postdocs who have transitioned to staff roles (e.g. senior scientist, instructor) should have time spent as a postdoc count towards years of employment for matched contributions. Data on the number of postdocs making the transition to staff roles each year should be made accessible.\nSURPAS should reach out to the Santa Clara County Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to receive a Know Your Rights Training to better understand employee rights we possess.\nEnsuring that Postdocs have a ‘seat at the table’ on all groups and committees making decisions which affect them. This representation must be in the form of voting seats - the ability to discuss but not directly participate in decision making is infantilizing. Any community feedback events and townhalls must include proactive outreach to postdocs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is general recognition that the Stanford postdoc community is not representative of the diversity of the population (either of Stanford undergraduate diversity or the US national diversity) and efforts should be made to rectify this. In general, postdocs from minoritized backgrounds do not feel supported by Stanford and often feel isolated or lacking in community. There is recognition that the diversity of the postdoc pool is the diversity of the future faculty pool. There have been lots of conversations and many ideas over the past decade or so, but relatively little action or progress has been made.\n\n\n\nThere is some progress that is worth celebrating:\n\nThe Stanford Postdoctoral Recruitment Initiative in Sciences and Medicine (PRISM) program and its expansion, run by the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs.10 This program assists postdoctoral candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to visit Stanford’s campus, meet current postdocs and interview with faculty, covering the costs of travel, accommodation and food for the visit.\nThe provision of the Diversity Center of Representation and Empowerment (D-CORE) space, a permanent physical space, within the School of Medicine.11 This space is open for diversity and inclusion focused events and meetings, and includes a Racial Justice Library.\nThe creation of the Certificate in Critical Consciousness and Anti-Oppressive Praxis (CCC&AOP) Program, initially (2019/20) operating within the School of Medicine and now (2022/23) within the Office of Inclusion, Community and Integrative Learning (ICIL).12 This program, grounded in critical theory and Black Feminism, seeks to provide training for graduate students and postdocs towards critical understandings of identity and positionality, the ability to identify present and historical oppressive structures, and a developed awareness of inclusive practices for transformative change.\nA new program within the School of Medicine for “diversity postdoc fellowships”. This program was launched in 2021 as the Propel Postdoctoral Scholars Program.13 It provides a fellowship of $10,000 on top of the base postdoc salary to 10 postdocs per year as well as professional development and networking opportunities.\n\nDecentralization of Stanford is a serious and ongoing issue. Funding/budgets and policy (e.g. training) are arranged separately by School or Department and hiring/recruitment of postdocs is done by individual PIs. In some ways this is a positive - for example, certain schools and departments have started their own fellowship programs or recruitment/inclusivity initiatives without having to get approval across the university. However, this requires more work from postdocs themselves to lobby their own individual programs for support, rather than a combined effort across Stanford.\nWhat does the postdoc community look like? More than 60% of postdocs are “international” but there is no further breakdown of “international” by country or race or ethnicity, and international does not mean underrepresented. However, representation for racial groups within the United States have not been conflated with this “international” categorization in the IDEAL dashboard. Although goals for increasing DEI within the postdoc population can be supported by both of these categories, specific efforts toward improving the underrepresented populations (African American, Native American, etc.) have not yet improved representation at Stanford (it remains at 5%).\nMany of these and other postdoc-related issues rely on faculty engagement; however, Stanford prioritizes the autonomy of its faculty within its decentralized structure, making faculty buy-in a barrier to progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove conductance of DEI conversations, for instance by increasing representation of URM individuals on committees and improving awareness/training of those on committees, particularly for non-URM individuals. The University needs to hire more URM individuals to have a larger pool from which to select for committee service to prevent the creation of a ‘minority tax’ on specific individuals.\nIncrease DEI awareness and training for everyone, ideally universal training required on an annual basis (e.g., anti-racist training).\nTransparency on progress-to-date for DEI initiatives (e.g., IDEAL, surveys, etc.)\nRemuneration for individuals conducting DEI training or participating in DEI work, particularly those from URM backgrounds, including by consideration of DEI efforts and university service in hiring and tenure decisions.\nIncrease hiring/recruitment and retention of people from URM backgrounds, particularly African American people. Specific funding provided for these positions.\nDeveloping institutional relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions.\nContinued improvement of the postdoc community for underrepresented scholars, as retention is a key factor preventing growth of URM populations at Stanford. Feelings of isolation or exclusion are common; further improvements could involve the construction of a Postdoc Community Center or better integration with existing campus community centers, specific budget items for this sort of work, or dedicated administrators or offices instead of reliance on trainees to push forward initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Implementation” here refers to the practicalities of operating postdoc community and advocacy organizations. “Outreach” here refers to relationships external to Stanford for passing on knowledge of these implementation practices in order for it to be applied at other institutions.\nStanford has a large postdoc community with more than 2400 postdocs across campus. Stanford’s postdoc organizations have been operating for many years and have substantial buy-in from the University administration and from postdocs themselves. However, postdocs remain a largely invisible or under-acknowledged community within the University and within academia at large. Stanford’s postdoc community and community organizations are more robust than those at many other research institutions.\nPostdocs face unique challenges given the heterogeneity of our community. Since each Postdoc is hired individually, there is no ‘cohort’ analogous to the situation for graduate students. With the University’s decentralization, the integration of any postdoc into department communities is contingent upon the local conditions in that specific department. Identifying the needs of a community and engaging in advocacy first requires the existence of that community. Postdocs have implemented community and advocacy in a variety of ways, providing a strong foundation upon which to build. At the same time, the strategies and tactics of other groups within and beyond the University community can serve as inspiration for future developments. The uncertain status of postdocs within the University often contributes to missed connections and poor implementation of University-wide policies with regards to the postdoctoral community - actors beyond the postdoctoral community hold responsibility for actively working to ensure our inclusion in University-wide initiatives.\n\n\n\nSURPAS organizational structures are well-established, with multiple bodies (Council, Leadership, and Committees) that have been operating for many years and have undergone internal review at several points.\n\nThese structures have experienced significant challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, including fewer postdocs putting themselves forward to volunteer for SURPAS Leadership roles. Anecdotally, a small number of postdocs have low confidence that SURPAS is able to effect meaningful change for postdocs’ benefit and view SURPAS as being an administrative extension of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs, rather than an independent representative body.\n\nStanford’s postdoc affinity groups (Stanford Black Postdoc Association, Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association, LGBTQIA+ Postdocs, Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association) are similarly well-established within the Stanford community.\nMany other research institutions lack strong community and advocacy organizations for their postdocs.\nMonthly SURPAS Council meetings provide a forum for postdocs to learn about ongoing initiatives and how to get involved. Happy hours provide a venue for postdocs to destress and network to build community.\nPostdocs can and do take positions on specific issues by passing resolutions as Council.14 Individual postdocs can introduce a resolution at a Council meeting for voting for adoption by the Postdoc community at Stanford.\nIn other situations, open letters from committees or individuals with wide signature gathering from within the postdoc and university community has been an effective strategy to implement advocacy. (See Ongoing Stanford Postdoc Advocacy section).\nPostdocs have proactively done outreach and asserted their place as important stakeholders in the local community by advocating directly to Santa Clara County.15\nSURPAS has helped build community within the postdoctoral community by helping organize and participate in the Bay Area Postdoctoral Association and its Symposium.16\nPostdocs led the creation of the “Be a Better Ally” series as a growth from the Someone Like Me mentoring program. Postdocs take leadership roles in creating programs that can be adopted and supported with university resources.\nThere is poor implementation for postdocs within the university bureaucracy. The university states the Individual Development Plan (IDP) is an important required mentorship meeting between postdocs and their advisors, but the website for reporting the IDP was down for over a year.17 Failure to update basic infrastructure indicates postdocs are not a priority for distribution of university resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop stronger connections with other university groups (e.g. GSC and Undergraduate Senate - pass joint resolution by all three bodies to enable SURPAS to have a mechanism for bringing topics to faculty senate agenda).\nDevelop connection with medical residents since they are at a similar career stage in medical training.\nDevelop deeper connections with other postdoc associations in the area (e.g. UCSF, UC Berkeley).\nGet a reporter from Stanford Daily to attend monthly council meetings (there is someone on the grad student beat who covers weekly GSC meetings).\nMore focus from administrators on including postdocs - there should be a postdoc in the room for most conversations (e.g. university search committees). Active outreach to our community is necessary.\nKeep an eye for Stanford re-applying for General Use Permit from the county so postdocs can attend meetings and advocate directly to the County Board of Supervisors for our needs. There is potential for solidarity with graduate students as was done in the past.\nOrientation is overwhelming and needs to be revamped or have follow up after a bit of time. New postdocs are inundated with information that is too much to absorb all at once and much gets lost; then there is no follow-up.\nStanford’s postdoc organizations have an opportunity to provide more guidance and resources to postdocs at other institutions, either to promote the creation of new postdoc associations or to share ideas for better events or programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "title": "Postdoc Focus Groups 2021",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We conducted in-depth, hour-long, open-ended conversations about the present and future of the postdoctoral experience with groups of between two and ten postdocs. Twelve different focus group sessions were held between March and December 2021 with a total of 50 participants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all focus groups were conducted virtually via Zoom. As an expression of our appreciation for their time and energy, participants were offered reimbursement for lunch up to the value of $15 each. This cost was supported by SURPAS.\nTo ensure that postdocs from as many different identities as possible were included in our conversations, we hosted focus groups that were specifically advertised for historically minoritized groups, including the Stanford Black Postdoc Association, Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association, LGBTQIA+ Postdocs, Postdocs with Dependents, and Late-stage Postdocs. Postdocs with these identities were also welcome to join the focus groups that were advertised to the postdoc community at large.\nAll focus groups were conducted in the same open-ended manner according to the template provided in Appendix B: How to Run a Long Range Planning Focus Group. Focus group participants were initially presented with a broad question: “What should the postdoc experience at Stanford look like in 2030?” If necessary to stimulate further conversation, additional follow-up questions were posed. Questions were deliberately broad and open-ended in order to not bias the responses of the participants; we wanted participants to raise the issues that were already on their minds, rather than seek their response to previously identified issues. To this end, focus groups with historically minoritized groups were not directed to focus their comments on issues that might be specifically relevant to their group. Instead, the same broad questions were posed to these groups.\nDetailed notes for each focus group were taken during the conversations by an assigned notetaker (a Committee member), who then wrote a summary of the main topics raised within that session. After all the focus groups had been completed, these summaries were compiled into a single document. The themes below were identified from that compilation document as frequently raised topics. These themes represent the topics that were most commonly raised by focus group participants. They do not represent an exhaustive account of everything that was discussed.\nFocus group conversations were recorded via Zoom (following verbal consent from all participants) and these recordings were later transcribed to text by the Committee members. Quotations included below that address particular themes were selected from these transcripts.\n\n\n\nOur Focus Group participants spanned a wide range of departments (Figure 12, left panel) and length of time (Figure 1, right panel) as a postdoc at Stanford. Participants self-identified as being from the following departments at Stanford (Figure 1, left panel), and this was representative of the different schools and departments present at Stanford. The participants also spent varying amounts of time as a Postdoc at Stanford (Figure 1, right panel).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of departments and time spent as Postdocs at Stanford of focus group participants.\n\n\nThe percentage of Focus Group sessions in which each identified theme was mentioned were as follows:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Percentage of focus groups in which each theme was raised.\n\n\nThe views presented in this section were from a diverse pool of Postdocs and the themes that were identified during the Focus Group sessions as shown in Figure 2 are summarized below.\n\n\n\n(N.B. The Focus Groups were conducted in 2021, prior to the intense inflation of 2022. As of December 2022, the postdoc minimum salary has not been raised commensurate with inflation. Therefore, postdocs’ purchasing power has decreased since the Focus Group conversations.)\nPostdocs at Stanford struggle with the extremely high cost of living in the Bay Area. This was the challenge most consistently reported by Focus Group participants. Unprompted, it was raised in all but one of the groups. This suggests a high mental toll on the postdoc community due to this single issue.\nPostdoc pay is viewed, almost universally, as low and insufficient for living in the areas around Stanford. Housing costs, as the single biggest expense for most households, are extremely high. One Focus Group participant reported requiring 75% of their postdoc income to cover just housing and dependent care expenses. Childcare, where it is accessible, is also extremely expensive (see the next section: “2. Postdoc Parents Face Very High Costs and Low Access to Childcare”). Moving to Stanford from abroad (>60% of Stanford’s postdocs are international) involves substantial additional expenses that Stanford does not assist with. Commuting is another substantial cost that occupies postdocs’ minds.\nParticipants questioned how many potential postdocs are choosing not to come to Stanford because of the very real affordability difficulties. Stanford is losing out on an unknown number of excellent candidates as a result. Another participant put it more frankly: “Doing a postdoc [here] is not accessible to people who need to work to earn a living.” Others cited financial stress as negatively impacting their research productivity. This should be particularly concerning to academic institutions and Principal Investigators who hire postdocs. Postdocs are very often the researchers who are responsible for driving key aspects of research and mentoring within the university setting.\nParticipants offered a range of potential actions that could help to address this situation. They suggested: Stanford should build more housing that could be provided to postdocs at a subsidy (and thereby be affordable); Stanford should provide more financial assistance in general; Stanford should raise the Minimum Postdoc Salary to be equivalent to that paid by industry; Stanford should have a short-term housing provision to assist incoming postdocs with their transition from elsewhere into local (non-Stanford) housing; Stanford should provide free meals for postdocs; postdoc salary, benefits, and support system should be boosted substantially.\n\n“Postdocs should be making enough money to live in this area without having to worry or going into debt.”\n\n\n“I think the cost of living in the Bay Area is outrageous, so compensation along those lines to the extent that we can live as adults would be a major component in making the postdoc better.”\n\n\n“It’s already such a financial hit to take this salary, which actually is good here compared to most other places. It is still much lower than what all my former classmates are getting in industry, but they are also getting matched 401(k) [retirement savings]. That would be huge to have a few more years of compound interest retirement savings, would be really really big.”\n\n\n“Just build more houses! Why are they not working more to have more housing for postdocs? To make sure their employees can stay on campus and work on-site to make less traffic in and out of the campus.”\n\n\n\n\n(N.B. The Focus Groups were conducted in 2021. Stanford’s Postdoctoral Scholar Family Grant program increased the maximum amount from $5000 to $10,000 in January 2022.)\nMany postdocs feel that starting a family is incompatible with being a postdoc. In our Focus Group conversations, the primary difficulties cited were: the lack of access to childcare (limited places, long waitlists) and the extremely high cost of childcare (relative to postdoc salary). As a result of these lack of resources, some postdocs choose to forgo starting a family while they are a postdoc. This is a source of considerable concern and frustration for some postdocs.\nOne Focus Group participant stated that the only model for having children as a postdoc that is workable, although still not easy, is for the postdoc to have a partner who works in a much higher paid field (such as the tech industry) and to use the childcare provision of the partner’s workplace (i.e. not use Stanford’s childcare facilities and not rely on the postdoc’s compensation). All other models are extremely challenging. As an example, one participant, in order to support their two children and also work as a postdoc at Stanford, had to split their family across multiple states for years at a time in order to make ends meet. Where postdocs are also immigrants (>60% of postdocs at Stanford are international), the situation can be even more dire as postdocs may have a dependent spouse/partner who is not able to work due to visa restrictions.\nStanford does have a Postdoctoral Scholar Family Grant program, in part aimed at subsidizing the high cost of childcare. While Focus Group participants acknowledged that any assistance with these extremely high costs is helpful, the current level of support is not sufficient; more assistance is required because the maximum hardship fund award ($5000, as of 2021) is only a small fraction of the cost of childcare. Further, positioning this fund as “hardship-only” greatly raises the barrier for postdocs to apply for it as it suggests the postdoc has failed in some way (with associated feelings of shame or guilt) if they cannot balance the extremely high costs of childcare with their relatively low pay. This has the potential to exacerbate mental health issues of postdocs with dependents, a population that is likely to be more vulnerable to mental health issues than even the general population of academia which already has higher prevalence of mental health issues than the wider population.\nOn the other hand, several participants cited the flexibility of their job to manage their own time as being a big plus for taking care of a baby.\nDespite the challenges, many postdocs do choose to have children while working as a postdoc or are already supporting dependents. Each year some 50 postdocs at Stanford become parents or carers. As such, these are critical and ongoing challenges for many postdocs at Stanford.\n\n“Living here, I cannot imagine myself having a kid with me being the only earning member, or even if my husband is a postdoc. My husband is not a postdoc, he works in tech, so that gives us a little more financial stability and mental relaxation.”\n\n\n“I don’t have a child but I’m thinking about it. One of my thoughts was to never get pregnant and have a child while I’m at Stanford because I won’t be able to finance it.”\n\n\n“[Regarding Stanford childcare grants:] I’m grateful for any money that we can get our hands on. Like any dollars is great in addition to our salary. But at the same time, it’s a monthly cost of two grand for daycare. So five grand is two months.”\n\n\n“My husband is still on the East Coast, so I’m managing our two kids by myself in the Bay Area and I have to kind of structure my work, like the actual time I spend in the lab, with going to pick them up because I actually cannot afford childcare. So I have to drop them off at school and then rush to Stanford and then maximize as much time as I can get out of the limited time that I have.”\n\n\n\n\nFocus Group participants were complimentary and appreciative of the high quality research environment at Stanford. The availability of research resources, such as core facilities and instruments, as well as the sharing of knowledge through regular seminars, workshops, bootcamps, meetings, and training opportunities all make Stanford a great place for doing research.\nParticipants also praised the strong postdoc community at Stanford. Great peer groups and various support-group activities were cited as key parts of the research environment. In-person social events (such as happy hours and coffee socials) in particular were raised as important opportunities for bringing postdocs together, providing space for both social and professional networking, and for fostering collaborations and sharing expertise.\nWhile connections at Stanford were generally considered an existing strength, some participants expressed a desire for more opportunities for researchers who work on similar topics to gather to discuss ideas and collaborations. Postdocs who had joined Stanford during the COVID-19 pandemic and who therefore had yet to experience SURPAS in-person social events (which were not permitted due to the risk to the community’s health) unsurprisingly expressed a desire for more in-person social events. Some postdocs who are based away from the main Stanford campus, such as those working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), desired more social events that were accessible to them.\n\n“Stanford is definitely a land of opportunity in the sense that whatever you want to do there’s probably a way to do it here.”\n\n\n“If you want to do it, you have access to it. And I think Stanford does a pretty good job of that.”\n\n\n“SURPAS is a really powerful instrument of postdoc empowerment. And I think that it’s growing. It has been a wonderful community for several decades for postdocs at Stanford. So I think it’s worth celebrating and acknowledging that community as well.”\n\n\n“I would say there are many opportunities at Stanford compared to [another university], where I came from. They don’t take care of their postdocs as much as Stanford does.”\n\n\n“The people have been the best part for me at Stanford. I didn’t quite expect that. I am thinking about my interaction with SLPA and the Black Postdoc Association. I have met some amazing women in those groups. They are not in my area of research, so I would not have met them just through science.”\n\n\n\n\nSeveral Focus Group participants expressed that a postdoc position does not provide job security and is highly unstable because of the short duration of postdoc contracts and the nature of the job. This instability makes longer-term life planning difficult, especially since many of the postdocs are in their late 20s to mid-30s and are thinking of starting a family or settling down. As Stanford typically provides a 1-year contract for postdocs, there is an uncertainty whether these contracts would be renewed, how many times the contract would be renewed and whether one can find their next position in time, in case the postdoc contracts are not renewed. Many participants said that this feeling of uncertainty is further exacerbated for international postdocs who are on a visa. Some participants suggested that providing a slightly longer postdoc contract, such as for two or three years, would provide some sense of short-term stability in order to plan their lives. Postdocs who have transitioned (after Stanford’s 5-year postdoc time limit) to a staff scientist role still face instability as contracts continue to be in 1-year increments and for international researchers this means renewals for work visas must be completed every year too.\n\n“For me, the main issue of being a postdoc here now is I don’t feel safe or have my job secured or even my stay in the country secured. For example, I cannot be unemployed for even one day because I am on a visa.”\n\n\n“Having even a two-year contract would let you focus more on the science rather than what’s next… How do I time-manage? I could be gone next year.”\n\n\n“It isn’t written down that you may have to move five or six times if you want that tenured permanent faculty position… that kind of structure is often also unclear.”\n\n\n\n\nMany Focus Group participants expressed a desire for more structure within their postdoc. The primary current system of providing postdoc structure – the Individual Development Planning (IDP) scheme – is either inappropriate (because it focuses on a yearly performance cycle rather than developing a career-focused plan) or in many cases simply not implemented. Suggestions for more formal or organized postdoctoral training included: a centralized set of guidelines for all postdocs; more check-ins or check-points with one’s supervisor; having an advisory committee and meeting with them regularly; having advisors who are external to one’s research group/department but are aligned with one’s research goals and meeting with them regularly; internship opportunities; exit surveys; and predefined rules for publishing. Mentorship training for Principal Investigators (PIs) was also raised as a suggestion to improve postdoc training, implying that postdocs feel PIs are not adequately prepared for their formal role as mentors.\nThree factors contributed heavily to these conversations. Firstly, the ambiguous status of postdocs within the University setting: Are postdocs students or employees? (See theme: “7. Ambiguous Status of Postdocs on Campus Leads to Feelings of Exclusion.”) Secondly, the lack of clear expectations: How long is a postdoc? When is it complete? What do I need to achieve? What is the expected number of outputs? How independent am I meant to be from my supervisor? Thirdly, Stanford is highly decentralized and postdocs’ experiences are highly dependent on their Principal Investigator.\nParticipants expressed that the orientation period at Stanford was overwhelming: there was too much information presented at once to properly absorb. An orientation recap several months after arrival was suggested to address this.\nSeveral participants expressed that postdoc time at Stanford should not be limited to five years because high quality and innovative work takes time to produce; such a time-limit hinders scientific inquiry. Others felt that a time limit for this career stage was necessary, in order that postdocs could be pushed to find a permanent position and not linger forever as a postdoc.\n\n“[I would like for] a postdoc be seen as a more structured training position rather than what it is right now, which is a holding pattern where postdocs are expected to make their own way while still being capable and not being given a lot of independence responsibilities.”\n\n\n“Here at Stanford, they are very proud of the one-year document that we share with our PIs on our plans for the future. However, the university does not do anything with them; does not do any reports on what is expected for postdoc.”\n\n\n“The postdoc check-in list is quite nice, I have to say, for the first week but after that, what happens? I don’t know.”\n\n\n“It’s obviously nicer if there were more opportunities for people who want to stay on longer to stay on longer in some official capacity. That also provides stability from a family planning perspective, long-term planning perspective, you know, knowing that you have a job long term.”\n\n\n“I do think that some time limit is good to promote that we try to find some permanent job in the long run.”\n\n\n\n\nPostdocs at Stanford, particularly the international community, expressed that understanding and navigating the US funding system was difficult. Participants attributed two main reasons for this difficulty: one is the lack of awareness regarding the various grants and funding opportunities available to postdocs and the second is the paucity in grants available to international postdocs. Most of the grants currently available require either permanent residency (Green Cards) or US citizenship, limiting opportunities for International postdocs.\nMany people wanting to transition to faculty were unaware about how the grant system in the USA functions and which grants they can apply to. Participants suggested that having a systematic resource as a centralized document with useful links will be very helpful. Other criticisms that were raised was the lack of support from their supervisors on writing individual grants since most of the focus was on grants for the supervisor and/or for the project the postdoc was already working on.\nFor a successful transition to a faculty position, one criterion is the ability of the candidate to secure independent funding. One participant mentioned that Stanford policies make it extremely difficult for postdocs to have their names on grants as a Principal investigator (PI). This negatively impacts the postdoc’s faculty application since there is no proof of their grant writing or grant acquiring skill. Having PI status on grant applications is crucial for the success of postdocs at Stanford looking for an academic career track.\n\n“If you come from somewhere else, it’s really hard to understand the American landscape on grants and what it means to be a postdoc here.”\n\n\n“The first thing that popped across for opportunities I wish I had, would be that I can’t be a listed PI on a grant. I have shared this story ‘n’ number of times, I got a sequencing grant that had no money exchanged, I wrote it myself, my PI was a co [PI on the grant], I submitted it. They were literally taking my samples and sequencing them and Stanford sponsored programs made them take my name off of the entire thing. And that drives me insane!”\n\n\n\n\nSeveral participants from the Focus Groups felt that the positioning of postdocs within the academic structure of Stanford (or for that matter any University) is ambiguous. They are neither staff nor students. They do not have the so-called employee benefits. There is a dichotomy in the present situation. Although postdocs are in a trainee phase, everyone holds terminal degrees and are already experts in their respective fields. The liminal space postdocs occupy between faculty and graduate student makes it feel like they are excluded from benefits of either group. Many of them explained that unlike other periods of their academic careers, they did not join Stanford as a cohort, as each postdoc starts their position at a different time of year, which can often lead to feeling isolated and/or excluded from their peers.\nDue to this ambiguous status of postdocs, many participants felt they were losing benefits, such as retirement savings plans, which would have been available to them if they were considered as staff. Losing five years of one’s working years without such plans or savings (which is already meager due to the low current postdoc salary versus the high cost of living) has immense financial implications when postdocs are planning for their future livelihoods. Some participants even said that this ambiguous status made it difficult to reach out to the relevant administrative staff to seek help in solving certain issues. Participants suggested that having a clear definition of postdocs within the Stanford academic setting would not only make administrative policies easier, but also help to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion on campus.\n\n“I feel like postdocs are an invisible population on campus.”\n\n\n“It is quite a solitary type of job, being a postdoc. So you do work quite a lot on your own and check in a few times per week or everyday with your supervisor but I didn’t realize how solitary it was.”\n\n\n“You’re sometimes treated as an equal and sometimes you’re not. It’s this in-between of a postdoc life. Sometimes you’re treated as a PhD student, sometimes you’re treated like a professor.”\n\n\n“The postdoc status at Stanford is a little bit awkward, when I first joined, because I didn’t have a sense of whether I am faculty, student, or staff. Stanford treats postdocs as students but ASSU [Associated Students of Stanford University] doesn’t have a council for postdocs, they just care about other students. The last time I met OPA [Office for Postdoctoral Affairs] they said that because students pay tuition they have more power.”\n\n\n“[Another prominent university] treats its postdocs like faculty and Stanford absolutely has no desire to do that.”\n\n\n“Stanford doesn’t really think of us as workers which became an issue when they wanted to make me staff… My time as a postdoc didn’t count towards staff benefits: vacation days didn’t roll over, I didn’t immediately start on the retirement matching. They said my postdoc didn’t count towards staff [benefits] because I was a student. Recognition [for postdocs] as workers would be much appreciated.”\n\n\n\n\nMany Focus Group participants emphasized the importance of finding diverse postdoc candidates and also keeping diverse postdocs, the implication being that Stanford does not provide an inclusive environment that diverse postdocs would want to continue working at. Some participants were concerned that Principal Investigators (PIs) were hiring postdocs who were of a similar mindset and identity as themselves. Others expressed that postdocs are equally responsible for improving diversity across campus as are PIs and must find ways to promote diversity amongst their communities.\nSeveral participants made the connection between affordability pressures and impacts on diversity – diverse candidates are less likely to choose to come to Stanford if the postdoc salary does not match the cost of living. One participant expressed that Stanford needs to be more competitive in order to attract postdocs who are parents and come from underrepresented minority backgrounds.\nOut of twelve Focus Group sessions, issues related to Justice, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging were raised explicitly in just four. This was despite the relatively recent turmoil following the high-profile murder of George Floyd in 2020. Even for Focus Groups with participants drawn from Postdoc Affinity Groups (e.g. Stanford Black Postdoc Association, Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association, LGBTQIA+ Postdocs), for whom Justice, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging concerns might be more salient than for postdocs from dominant identities, the conversations were much more centered around difficulties fulfilling basic needs, such as housing, food, and childcare, than around microaggressions or police discrimination on campus, for instance. This suggests that the best way to improve Justice, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging amongst postdocs at Stanford in the first instance is to address affordability concerns.\n\n“If the university is interested in getting diverse people… not just diverse by race but economic status, where they are living in the world… the transition from graduate school to postdoc, that move is really expensive and it puts you in debt and you are not going to get paid for the first two months, till you move here… There’s “finding the diverse candidates” and then there’s “supporting them when they are here”. I think the “supporting them when they are here” is the hardest part and I think that’s where the institution could do a better job.”\n\n\n“I would like to see more representative cohorts…to foster a more inclusive environment where people are more comfortable.”\n\n\n“I wish the postdoc community at Stanford can be more diverse in the future, not only to increase the population of the underrepresented groups but also to see more collaboration, and interdisciplinary research.”\n\n\n“I know our group has a bit of a gender imbalance for sure. I know they’re trying to address that. I think they’re hiring a few more women postdocs and staff scientists, but I think in our group we have a pretty non-diverse group. So I think more diversity is always gonna be good as well.”\n\n\n“To address these problems with diversity, it’s just we have to start from all angles. Both from the top and from the bottom. So also the postdocs have to help each other, to promote people from different backgrounds and different cultures and different research skills.”\n\n\n\n\nParticipants expressed that there is little incentive for postdocs at Stanford to engage in any profession-relevant activities that are not research, such as communication of science, developing teaching skills, or engaging in other forms of outreach and service with the local community.\nSeveral participants expressed frustration that postdocs were not given credit for the work that they do. Examples of this non-credited or under-recognized work included: writing and editing of manuscripts; reviewing manuscripts; and mentoring graduate students or undergraduates in the lab.\nOthers were frustrated that Stanford actively limits postdocs’ ability to be recognized as key contributors to grants as a result of not being able to be listed as “principal investigators” on grant applications, thereby hampering academic job prospects. Stanford’s system for providing “PI waivers” is limited to only certain grants (e.g. the NIH’s K99 grant) and predominantly used within the School of Medicine and not by other Schools within the University.\nOne participant’s view was that the postdoc position is an inherently exploitative one; that a postdoc is first and foremost a source of cheap labor for PIs. Other participants, who had heard similar views, were frustrated with this perspective and found it hurtful to be thought of in this way, suggesting an additional mental toll on top of the financial one.\nSome expressed a desire for job models that make the research endeavor in science collaborative, rather than competitive. They also wanted a restructuring of the academic career such that individuals were not required to persist through years of low wages or the requirement to move location multiple times or to have no parental leave.\n\n“In terms of reimagining what a postdoc can be, it is a really hard question because it is inherently an exploitative position, right? Your interests as a postdoc are inherently not aligned with your advisors because you are a source of cheap and highly skilled labor for them.”\n\n\n“People our age are working hard to bust that myth that you only have to publish in big journals. But obviously there is a caveat - can you get an academic position by publishing in small journals? … I think the whole stress of publishing in big journals should not be there for postdocs.”\n\n\n“Depending on the lab, postdocs can play a very major role in practice, but not in paper, [for example] in the mentoring of graduate students, but then the PI gets all the ‘credit’. We are in this weird role where we are supposed to do just science but there are so many more things that are expected, unspoken expected….I am just realizing how important of a role postdocs can play for the mentoring of future students but they don’t get officially recognized.”\n\n\n“[Stanford] try really hard to make sure you can’t have your name on any grant, which in my experience made it very difficult to get a faculty job because there’s no proof that I have contributed to funded projects except for my boss writing a recommendation letter, and if we didn’t have a great relationship that would never be showcased.”\n\n\n\n\nOn a number of occasions, Focus Group participants expressed a desire for a resource or opportunity that was in fact already available to them at Stanford. This speaks to a lack of effective communication structures and channels for postdocs. One participant said that they receive a huge number of emails from Stanford, of which 80% are irrelevant and needed to be sorted through in order to find the relevant 20%. Others expressed that there is far too much information conveyed during the orientation process for postdocs. One suggested solution for this issue was for the University to offer a follow-up information session several months or even a year after orientation.\nThe following resources are examples that do address concerns that some participants spoke about:\n\nStanford Financial Credit Union: for getting a bank account before having a permanent residential address and for getting a credit card without a pre-existing credit score.\nGrant-Writing Academy: for assistance with writing grant proposals.\nBioSci Careers: for non-academic job resources and advice for postdocs with a biomedical focus.\nPostdoc Teaching Certificate: for obtaining training and a qualification in teaching skills.\n\nSome participants mentioned that they found that the most efficient way to find relevant information and have their questions answered was often to chat with other postdocs at SURPAS social events. However, they expressed concern that relying on this mechanism was potentially unreliable.\nBetter communication strategies are required on campus in order for postdocs to be connected up with existing resources that would be relevant and helpful to them.\n\n“I think those classes and courses are great and I’m really grateful that Stanford offers them. But in my first year, I definitely did not know that they were out there.”\n\n\n“Orientation is overwhelming. I would say that the first orientation is very overwhelming. They are telling you about benefits, health insurance, taxes and I don’t know what all of that means. It’s a lot. So maybe you could have a follow-up orientation two-months post. It was a lot of information and looking back at it now, it was there, but I didn’t digest it fully at the time.”"

    "text": "Findings\nIn brief, the findings of this Report are:\n\nPostdocs in academia are underpaid.\nIn real terms, postdocs at Stanford are additionally underpaid and have lost ground in recent years relative to local cost of living.\nPostdocs at Stanford with dependents face extreme financial pressures.\nMost postdocs in academia do not become tenure-track researchers.\nPostdocs at Stanford crave more structured training and more information on expectations and outcomes.\nPostdocs at Stanford exist in an occupational limbo; not students, not staff.\nPostdocs at Stanford are underappreciated, performing labor that goes unacknowledged and/or uncredited.\nPostdocs at Stanford appreciate the resources and opportunities for research provided by Stanford, and love the vibrant postdoc community.\nPostdocs at Stanford continue to face specific Justice, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging issues. However, these are overshadowed by difficulties in fulfilling basic human needs.\nPostdocs at Stanford face job instability in the short term because of single-year contracts and in the longer term because of the 5-year postdoc term limit at Stanford.\nPostdocs at Stanford who are international (>60%) face additional job and life instability due to single-year visa extensions."

    "section": "Principles",
    "text": "Principles\n\nPostdocs should be appreciated and not exploited.\n\nPostdocs should receive salary and benefits commensurate with their existing high level of training and their expected contributions to the research enterprise.\nPostdocs at Stanford should receive yearly increases in their salary in accordance with their increasing research experience (as is done by the NIH and was done in the past at Stanford).\nPostdocs at Stanford should be classed as advanced research staff and not as students or trainees, and receive employment benefits in accordance with this.\n\nPostdocs’ basic needs should be met.\n\nOn top of the level of compensation that acknowledges postdocs’ experience and contributions (see above), postdoc salary and benefits at Stanford should be increased to account for the high cost-of-living of the local area.\nThe minimum salary should be set at a level such that postdocs do not need to spend more than 30% of their income on housing.\nStanford should provide childcare facilities such that all postdocs are able to find a place for their child/ren and postdocs should not be required to spend more than 30% of their income on childcare.\n\nPostdocs should have job security.\n\nThe postdoc period should not be limited to 5 years. There should be no distinction made between “postdocs” and “research staff”. Postdocs are advanced research staff.\nPostdocs should be employed as permanent staff, with provisions to terminate their employment if explicitly stated conditions are not met, rather than yearly contracts.\nWork visas should be sought and supported to reflect this permanent staff work status in order to allow for international researchers to continue to work at Stanford as now.\n\nPostdocs should receive job structure and career support outside of their immediate research groups.\n\nStructured guidance should be provided to postdocs at multiple points throughout their time at Stanford, ideally in a cohort setting. The existing postdoc orientation session run by OPA is appreciated but overwhelming.\nCareer tracking of past postdocs should be undertaken and the findings communicated to current postdocs in the context of career planning.\nGroup leaders should receive training to improve their mentorship skills.\n\nPostdocs should be actively included in University business.\n\nPostdocs should continue to have representatives sit on University committees and working groups, ideally with voting rights.\nPostdocs should have a formal mechanism for raising issues to the Faculty Senate."

    "text": "This Report contextualizes the role of postdocs within academia as viewed by postdocs themselves. The national landscape for postdoc employment within the United States and at Stanford specifically was analyzed by drawing from a wide variety of reputable sources in the Opportunities for Early Career Researchers: Competitive Landscape for Postdocs section. An overview of previous advocacy efforts performed by organized postdocs at Stanford was provided in the A Quarter Century of Postdoc Advocacy at Stanford: Review of Previous Work section. The mindset and goals for postdocs at Stanford in the early 2020s was ascertained in the Conversations with Postdocs at Stanford: Focus Groups 2021 section. Models of postdoc advocacy and data about contemporary issues of concern for postdocs are provided in the Ongoing Postdoc Advocacy at Stanford: Surveys and Letters 2021/2022 section. Issues facing postdocs and expectations for how various stakeholders can address them are included in the Recommendations section.\nWith this Report, SURPAS is positioning postdocs as an important stakeholder within the University and academic research settings. The Report serves as a form of institutional memory for future postdocs at Stanford, crystallizing many efforts and goals undertaken by postdoc organizers in a single document and helping to combat the issues that arise due to the transient nature of the postdoc as it currently exists. The vision for the future of postdocs at Stanford presented within this Report includes data and ideas that future postdoc leaders can leverage. This Report also serves as a communication to other stakeholders within the University and academic communities of postdoc goals and expectations.\nThe issues, themes, and recommendations within this report are neither groundbreaking nor unique. Many of the same themes emerged in the Fall 2022 survey of postdocs conducted by the National Postdoc Association.1 The issues and recommended solutions echo calls made by researchers at various levels of the academic research enterprise for more than two decades. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed and exacerbated many existing trends, but these inequities are longstanding.\nPostdocs at Stanford are relatively better resourced and organized compared with postdocs at other institutions but still face many challenges. It is the hope of the Committee that the materials contained within this Report can serve as a model for postdocs at other institutions to adapt to their own local conditions. Though Stanford employs a disproportionate share of postdocs compared with most other institutions in this country, the nearly 2500 postdocs at Stanford represent a small fraction of postdocs in the US. Additional data about the material conditions of postdocs at a wider variety of institutions will help provide a more complete picture of postdoc positionality.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Beginning in early 2020, SURPAS has been engaged in a Long Range Planning process, the purpose of which is to build a shared collective vision of the future of postdocs at Stanford.\nDuring this collaborative process, the SURPAS Long Range Planning Committee (“the Committee”) sought participation and feedback from all interested postdocs in order to formalize the expectations, hopes, and goals regarding life as a postdoc.\nThe mission of the Committee was to conduct a community-oriented, bottom-up process to assess the broad vision and strategic goals of the postdoc community and provide clear communication of these to all postdocs now and into the future, as well as to other stakeholders.\nThe Long Range Planning process sought to be a means of detailing what work postdocs believe needs to be done, providing recommendations for how to achieve change, and setting mile markers that future postdocs can use in their advocacy efforts.\nThe Committee conducted three major information-gathering efforts:\n\nthe first was to pull together an understanding of the competitive landscape for postdocs based upon published research, career-focused reporting, and labor statistics;\nthe second was to review past reports, presentations, and other documents produced by former postdoc representatives at Stanford, predominantly those operating within SURPAS or one of the postdoc affinity groups (Stanford Black Postdoc Association, Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association, LGBTQIA+ Postdocs, Stanford Chinese Postdoc Association); and,\nthe third was to conduct a series of focus groups with postdocs currently at Stanford to gain a deeper understanding of what postdocs are thinking about regarding their own experiences and the future of postdocs at Stanford.\n\nThe Committee then synthesized the information gathered through these three major efforts into the present Long Range Planning Report (“the Report”), which is to be made publicly accessible.\nMany issues brought before SURPAS require sustained advocacy for a number of years to bring about change. This Report aims to serve as a vehicle to coordinate advocacy for postdocs through time.\nThe Committee’s intention was to create a living document, with each new generation of postdocs engaging in their own Long Range Planning process to determine what a postdoc means to them.\nThis Report contains recommendations of action items for postdocs and other stakeholders within and beyond the University community. Recommended action items for other stakeholders within the University will clearly delineate postdoc goals and expectations of those in leadership positions.\nThe Committee recognizes that many postdocs will go on to leadership roles in their future careers and hopes that the information and recommendations contained within this Report may additionally provide a roadmap for progress to be made beyond Stanford.\nThe Long Range Planning process and this Report were deliberately focused on foregrounding the voices and efforts of postdocs themselves: “What do postdocs think about the postdoc role?”. Postdocs are oftentimes overlooked within the research enterprise and decisions are made on their behalf; sometimes with postdoc representatives in the room, sometimes not. No doubt postdocs exist within a complex research ecosystem and postdocs benefit greatly from the efforts of non-postdoc allies. However, with respect to the postdoc role, the thoughts of postdocs themselves should be paramount.\nWe hope to engage with the University as a unique and important stakeholder group while Stanford continues to execute the vision that emerged from the University-wide long range planning process.1\nThe Long Range Planning work contained within this Report spanned approximately January 2020 to December 2022. This means it was conducted in the context of: the COVID-19 pandemic; the murder of George Floyd (and countless other Black community members); the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol Building; multiple conservative Supreme Court decisions, including the striking down of the constitutional right to an abortion (Roe vs Wade, 1973); Stanford’s President becoming implicated in image manipulation in published papers; and the largest mobilization of academic workers for labor rights in United States history as 48,000 postdocs, graduate students, and researchers across the University of California system went on strike. Postdocs at Stanford were and continue to be impacted by all of these events.\nImportantly, the Committee was inspired and deeply influenced by the leadership of the Black community at Stanford in their clear and explicit statement of goals and values published in The Stanford Daily on Juneteenth 2020, entitled “Opinion: Letter to the President and Provost: Action items for achieving racial equity”.2 The Recommendations within this Report seek to emulate this by detailing action items that are similarly clear and directed.\nThe Committee actively sought to center the voices of the most marginalized members of our community through a process of outreach and engagement with postdoc affinity groups such as the Stanford Black Postdoc Association, the LGBTQIA+ Postdoc Group at Stanford, and the Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association."
