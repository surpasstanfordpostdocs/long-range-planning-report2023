<p><em>Postdocs at Stanford have been self-organized to represent their interests within the university community since at least 1998. SURPAS is governed by the following bylaws. SURPAS Council periodically votes on bylaws amendments to reflect changing needs of the organization and community; this process ensures new Council members are aware of our governing structure.</em></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history">History</h3>
<p>The Stanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS) was founded in 1998 to promote a community among Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford University. SURPAS is governed by the Council. The Council was formed in Spring of 1999, and addresses issues related to Postdoctoral Scholars at Stanford. The Council functions in advocacy and helps to maintain a social structure within the postdoctoral community.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Stanford University Postdoctoral Association previously used the acronym SUPD, which was often confused with the Stanford University Police Department. In 2013, the Council appointed a Name and Logo committee to report on the name confusion and potential alternatives. The committee reported that even though the Stanford Police department uses the acronym SUDPS, or Stanford University Department of Public Safety, confusion still occurs, and many alternative acronyms were already claimed by other organizations at Stanford. For instance, SUPA was already used by the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Association. The acronym SURPAS was identified as a viable alternative, which sounds like the word, “surpass” and has a meaning that aligns well with the mission of the Association. The council voted by majority on September 25, 2013, to adopt the acronym SURPAS.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-2-membership-of-registered-postdoctoral-scholars">Section 2: Membership of Registered Postdoctoral Scholars</h4>
<p>All registered Postdoctoral Scholars of Stanford University are members of SURPAS. Registered Postdoctoral Scholars of Stanford University shall be defined to include all Postdoctoral Scholars appointed by the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs of Stanford University. SURPAS recognizes that there are people working in similar positions [individuals who possess a doctoral degree (Ph.D., M.D., J.D., Ed.D., etc.) and conduct research under a Stanford faculty member’s sponsorship or supervision, but are not appointed by the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (such as Research Associates and Visiting Scholars)]. These individuals are not members of SURPAS, but are invited to participate in SURPAS events. SURPAS recognizes that Postdoctoral scholars may move into other non-tenure track trainee roles at Stanford upon expiration of the Postdoctoral scholar term limit or award of transitional funding. These former Postdocs may continue to be SURPAS members.</p>

Council members have the right to openly discuss decisions made by the Leadership Team and request a motion to override such decisions with a simple majority vote.</p></li>
<li><p>Council members must attend at least 9 (75%) council meetings in a year of service on council. Excused absences should be coordinated with the <strong>Operations Manager</strong> in advance of the meeting. Excused absences and canceled meetings will not be considered missed meetings. Council members missing 3 (25%) scheduled council meetings will be given a warning. Missing additional meetings thereafter will result in being removed from the roster and losing membership.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to attending council meetings, council members must significantly contribute to SURPAS activities and the well-being of postdocs at Stanford. For example, council members are required to either (a) serve on the leadership team (Article III), (b) serve as a Faculty Senate representative (Section 7), (c) be an active member of a SURPAS Committee (Sections 5 &amp; 6) or (d) be an active member of a postdoc affinity group. The council will review each member’s contribution to SURPAS and the well-being of postdocs at Stanford at the end of their one year term and can then vote on re-election to the SURPAS council.</p></li>
<li><p>Council members must ensure that pertinent information is disseminated to the postdoctoral population at large. They will communicate concerns to the Council from those Postdoctoral Scholars that they represent, and hold informal meetings with Postdoctoral Scholars as necessary.</p></li>

Stanford does not set limitations for interactions with the media. However, Council members are advised to think carefully about the experiences they can speak to and to critically interrogate the motivations of those seeking comment.

<p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday that is celebrated widely, most times without thought about the historical context. SURPAS, however, should be thoughtful about what Thanksgiving means both for Indigenous people and traditional family gatherings when messaging around this time. This could be an important opportunity for education about colonial violence and the centering of Indigenous heritage and sovereignty. Similarly, Winter brings a variety of holidays, each unique to their religion of origin and each celebrated by some and not others. Messaging around the Winter Holidays should be done with this in mind.</p>
