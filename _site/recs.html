<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This section of the Report contains recommendations to address the issues identified throughout the previous sections. For each identified issue, specific recommendations are provided for various stakeholder groups. These recommendations call on the stakeholder groups to continue, to change, or to begin a course of action. These recommendations aim to suggest specific policies and actions that comport with the general principles outlined in the Executive Summary. Even as specific policies are implemented, these principles can continue to guide advocacy for postdocs looking to be recognized as full and valued members of the academic research enterprise. These principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Postdocs should be appreciated and not exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Postdocs’ basic needs should be met.</p></li>
<li><p>Postdocs should have job security.</p></li>
<li><p>Postdocs should receive job structure and career support outside of their immediate research groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Postdocs should be actively included in University business.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first stakeholder group for each issue is postdocs themselves as individuals. Recommendations are informed by the lived experience of Committee members and the general postdoctoral population in recognition of the agency postdocs possess in taking direct action to improve their material conditions. The next recommendations are directed at SURPAS (i.e.&nbsp;postdocs working together collectively) and are a crystallization of institutional knowledge from long-serving postdoc organizers. Though most recommendations for postdocs collectively are targeted towards SURPAS specifically, postdocs can and do organize collectively in other ways (e.g.&nbsp;affinity groups); these organized postdocs can take advantage of these recommendations as well.</p>
<p>The next stakeholder group is Stanford Faculty, highlighting expectations postdocs have of their senior colleagues. The next stakeholder is the Stanford Administration, indicating what is expected of those with decision making power within the university structure. Stanford Administration exists at multiple different levels, ranging from university-wide (Provost level) to local (Department level) and in between (School level) and can have overlap with faculty who fill some administrative positions. We have suggested recommendations directed towards Stanford Admin in general but these may be best implemented at differing levels within that stakeholder group; the Committee leaves specifics of implementation to those who will perform that work.</p>
<p>Funding bodies (e.g.&nbsp;NIH, NSF, private funders) are included as the next stakeholder group to indicate postdoc perspectives on incentive structures within academic research. Publishing and professional organizations (e.g.&nbsp;journals, preprint servers, professional societies [e.g.&nbsp;National Postdoc Association, Biophysical Society]) are included as the next stakeholder group. Local community members, such as Stanford undergraduates, graduate students, or other non-postdoc groups in Stanford and the Bay Area, are included as the next stakeholder group to provide seeds for future collaboration. Local government is included as the next stakeholder, generally represented by the Board of Supervisors for Santa Clara County since Stanford sits on unincorporated county land. State and national governments represent the final stakeholder.</p>

<section id="costs-overall" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="costs-overall">Costs: Overall</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Many postdocs at Stanford struggle with covering basic needs for themselves and their families. While Stanford pays more than the NIH’s national minimum salary, the cost of living around Stanford is incredibly high and postdocs continue to struggle to meet necessary costs. Effectively addressing this critical issue would relieve postdocs of the enormous mental toll of financial precarity and allow them to focus on doing their best work.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>apply for supplemental grants provided by Stanford that can help cover some living expenses (e.g.&nbsp;the Family Grant, Childcare Grant, Backup childcare, and Emergency grant-in-aid).</li>
<li>continue to advocate for themselves to their faculty advisors, their department, and school for increases in salary.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>continue to advocate for increases to the Postdoc Minimum Salary.</li>
<li>reach out to and build solidarity with other academic postdocs in the Bay Area. (Postdocs at the University of California went on strike with their union at the end of 2022. SURPAS should invite the UC Postdoc Union to present at a SURPAS Council meeting.)</li>
<li>create a Postdoc Salary Committee to uncover data on local cost of living, postdoc salaries at peer institutions, and investigate other useful comparisons to generate well-justified and heavily evidence-based proposals for Stanford Postdoc Salaries, in support of the advocacy efforts of the SURPAS Co-Chairs.</li>
<li>continue to request aggregated salary data for the postdoc population from the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs.</li>
<li>continue regularly surveying postdocs in order to collect information about their salary level and cost of living pressures.</li>
<li>maintain a historical record of the Stanford Minimum Postdoc Salary (and related details) and the Area Median Income for Santa Clara County, to be used in future salary negotiations. (Refer to Data Tables in <a href="./appendixd.html">Appendix D</a>.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Faculty</em> should:
<ul>
<li>pay their own postdocs more.</li>
<li>advocate for postdoc salary increases within their own department and school and across the University at large.</li>
<li>include budget requests for postdoc salaries that reflect the cost of living in the Bay Area in grant applications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:
<ul>
<li>raise the Postdoc Minimum Salary to restore local area purchasing power for postdocs to pre-2019 levels. For the 2022-23 academic year, this would be $82,000.</li>
<li>raise the postdoc salary to at least the Low Income level (Low Income is defined by the federal government’s Department of Housing and Urban Development as 80% of Area Median Income, which for Santa Clara County in 2022 was $92,250) in Santa Clara County for a one-person household so a single postdoc supporting themselves is not required to live in poverty.</li>
<li>increase postdoc salary for each additional year of experience (for instance, by +3.5% per year), as is done by the NIH (i.e.&nbsp;have a graded salary scale for postdocs).</li>
<li>make aggregated postdoc salary data available and transparent on a yearly basis, so that all postdocs at Stanford have a clear understanding of where their own salary fits within the distribution of postdoc salaries at Stanford.</li>
<li>leverage Stanford’s Buffer funds in order to help cover Minimum Postdoc Salaries, for example to offset shortfalls in faculty-obtained grants from funding agencies.</li>
<li>undertake targeted fundraising and create an endowed fund that covers the gap between NIH Minimum Salary and the Low Income level in Santa Clara County ($92,250 in 2022) for postdoc salaries so that faculty can afford to hire postdocs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Funding Bodies</em> should:
<ul>
<li>increase their mandated Minimum Postdoc Salary to account for the existing advanced training and expected research contributions of postdocs.</li>
<li>normalize their minimum funding levels to account for the cost of living where postdocs work.</li>
<li>provide increased funds for senior postdoctoral fellows and research scientists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Publishing and Professional Organizations</em> should:
<ul>
<li>highlight the lived reality of material conditions for postdocs and advocate for increased salaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Local Community</em> should:
<ul>
<li>(Bay Area postdoc associations) collaborate with postdocs at Stanford to advocate collectively for better compensation and conditions for all postdocs, particularly given the high cost of living in the Bay Area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors</em> should:
<ul>
<li>ensure postdocs are included in any studies about workers at Stanford as a specific stakeholder group.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>State and National Governments</em> should:
<ul>
<li>allocate funds to support increased salaries for researchers.</li>
<li>create policies to forgive student loans up to a certain dollar amount for every year of work as a postdoc for all postdocs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="costs-food-insecurity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="costs-food-insecurity">Costs: Food Insecurity</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Postdocs at Stanford suffer from food insecurity and the number has been rising in recent years. In Fall 2019, nearly 10% of postdocs suffered from food insecurity. During the COVID-19 pandemic and before the historic inflation of 2022, that number increased to 36% of postdocs suffering from food insecurity. At the January 2023 SURPAS Council meeting, postdocs were informed they were no longer eligible to utilize the pop-up food pantry created in 2020 (though the service would not turn anyone away).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>continue to avail themselves of the monthly pop-up food pantry as needed to combat food insecurity.</li>
<li>support each other, for instance through mutual aid efforts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>continue to advertise and send information about the monthly pop-up food pantry to the postdoc population.</li>
<li>continue to advocate for the Postdoc Minimum Salary to be increased.</li>
<li>continue to ask postdocs in regular surveys about their experience of food insecurity.</li>
<li>continue to provide food at all SURPAS-hosted events at no cost to attendees.</li>
<li>form coalitions with other organized groups on campus (undergraduates, graduates, workers) to collectively address this issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Faculty</em> should:
<ul>
<li>pay their postdocs more.</li>
<li>suggest and promote opportunities for providing postdocs with meals, for instance in one-on-one meetings or lab meetings.<br>
</li>
<li>seek departmental and/or school financial support in order to take your postdoc/s to lunch (as has been done during National Postdoc Appreciation Week in the past).</li>
<li>advertise the existence of the pop-up food pantry to incoming postdocs when they are hired to help new postdocs meet their basic needs.</li>
<li>proactively ask their employees about whether they are able to cover their own basic needs and those of their family on their current salary, and increase their salary accordingly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:
<ul>
<li>increase the Postdoc Minimum Salary so that in the future no postdocs and their families suffer from food insecurity. Ensure basic needs can be met for postdocs with their salaries in the high cost of living Bay Area.</li>
<li>offer subsidized meal plan services for postdocs on campus.</li>
<li>at the departmental and school level, provide financial support for faculty to provide food for postdocs, for instance in one-on-one meetings or lab meetings.</li>
<li>at the departmental and school level, provide financial support for faculty to take their postdoc/s to lunch (as has been done during National Postdoc Appreciation Week in the past).</li>
<li>publish data on monthly utilization of the pop-up food pantry.</li>
<li>ask about food insecurity on University-wide surveys, and make the data and results from these surveys publicly available.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Funding Bodies</em> should:
<ul>
<li>increase mandated minimum postdoc salaries and normalize these to the cost of living in the location of the institution.</li>
<li>penalize institutions that allow postdocs and other trainees to suffer from food insecurity (e.g.&nbsp;by lowering the Facilities and Administrative rate for delinquent universities).</li>
<li>provide funding for researchers to study food insecurity within the academic workforce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Publishing and Professional Organizations</em> should:
<ul>
<li>continue to highlight the difficulties faced by postdocs, including meeting their basic needs, in publications.</li>
<li>continue to provide subsidized membership and registration fees to postdocs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Local Community</em> should:
<ul>
<li>(Second Harvest Food Bank) evaluate their income limits for access to food banks in light of the historic inflation that occurred in 2022.</li>
<li>(Organized groups on campus) form coalitions with postdoc groups to collectively address this issue.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="costs-housing">Costs: Housing</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Very high housing costs in the areas around Stanford and the Bay Area in general mean that postdocs on the Stanford Minimum Salary are highly likely to need to live with one or more other wage-earning adults (e.g.&nbsp;partners, roommates, property owners) or else be Severely Rent Burdened. This issue also includes the related topic of transportation as it is fundamentally linked to housing.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>continue to advocate for subsidizing the Transitional Housing Program for incoming postdocs.</li>
<li>continue to advocate for the Caltrain GoPass program for postdocs (i.e.&nbsp;a CalTrain pass provided to postdocs at no cost to them, which improves affordability by allowing postdocs to live farther away from the University without them having to pay substantially more in transportation costs).</li>
<li>advocate directly to the County Board of Supervisors whenever Stanford reapplies for a new General Use Permit to govern expansion of University facilities.</li>
<li>organize/mediate the sharing of information about good housing situations to new and current postdocs (perhaps through the SURPAS Housing &amp; Transportation Committee).</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="costs-childcare">Costs: Childcare</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Childcare costs are very high in the vicinity of Stanford, and this is after the challenge of finding any available spot in local childcare programs, which often require children to be put on the waiting list before they are even born. The cost of childcare stretches family budgets to the absolute limit.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:

</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="costs-healthcare-for-dependents">Costs: Healthcare for Dependents</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>While the health insurance costs for postdocs who do not have dependents are low, the costs of healthcare for postdocs with dependents represent a very high proportion of their take-home income. Healthcare plans for postdocs consist of a single option and this option is geographically limited. As a result, postdocs who live and work at Stanford-affiliated locations outside the core counties serviced by the health plan (e.g.&nbsp;Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey County) face additional costs and complications.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>if possible, rely on health insurance plans from partners outside academia until such time as cost for benefits are in line with salaries for postdocs (this is an imperfect solution and will not be an option for all postdocs with dependents).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:

<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>The diversity of the postdoctoral population and the academic workforce at large does not match national or global demographics. Further, while there are some pockets of improvement, the culture and community at Stanford are not yet truly inclusive or equitable.

<section id="building-community" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-community">Building Community</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Building community within the postdoc population and within other local (and non-local) communities is essential for making friends, improving mental health, developing innovative collaborations and work satisfaction. Unfortunately, postdocs face more challenges to building community than other groups on campus as a result of working (often) solely within independent research groups that may or may not have any other postdocs in them, not being a part of any timed-entry cohort group (as graduate are, for instance), and have a great deal of pressure (internal or external) on them to work hard and perform at their best. These factors mean that structures to promote the building of community are even more important for postdocs.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>proactively participate in events within their lab, department, school, and across the University, especially postdoc organized events. In addition to forming community with postdocs, these other venues give postdocs the opportunity to integrate more effectively into the university-wide community.</li>
<li>continue to form community groups based on mutual interests. Contemporary examples include WhatsApp groups for hiking, cultural events, cycling, etc. organized on an ad hoc basis.</li>
<li>include advanced researchers and instructors who have transitioned from postdoc to staff roles and postdocs classified as visiting scholars as part of the postdoc community.</li>
<li>apply for funds from the Stanford Postdoctoral Initiative Fund (SPIF) for community-building events. Initial pilots for the Postdoc Wine Appreciation Club and Postdoc Reading Open Social Event (PROSE) Book Club were supported by SPIF.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:

<li>continue to support the work of the postdoc affinity groups (Stanford Black Postdoc Association [SBPA], Stanford Latinx Postdoc Association [SLPA], Stanford LGBTQIA+ Postdocs, Stanford Chinese Postdocs) in building community.</li>
<li>continue to offer small grants to postdocs for building community and enriching the postdoc experience via the Stanford Postdoctoral Initiative Fund (SPIF) program.<span class="citation" data-cites="spif.2023"><sup><a href="#ref-spif.2023" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span> This is required by <a href="./appendixa.html#article-ii-legislative-branch">Article II, Section 6</a> of the SURPAS By-Laws.</li>
<li>set up a ‘buddy system’ pairing newly arriving postdocs together in small groups to create a postdoc cohort. These groups can and should include some older postdoc volunteers who can help share knowledge and resources to the new cohorts.</li>
<li>actively invite postdocs who have transitioned into staff roles to join postdoc community events.</li>
<li>actively invite postdocs who are officially classified as Visiting Scholars to join postdoc community events.</li>
<li>advocate for the creation of an endowed fund to cover the yearly SURPAS operating budget.</li>
<li>explore strategies to develop an independent funding source, potentially following models from ASSU, which has been financially independent from the University since 1995,<span class="citation" data-cites="sse.2023"><sup><a href="#ref-sse.2023" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span> or The Stanford Daily, which has been independent of the University since 1973.<span class="citation" data-cites="daily.2023-3"><sup><a href="#ref-daily.2023-3" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Faculty</em> should:
<ul>
<li>proactively make sure postdocs are included in community building events at the lab, department, school, and university levels.</li>
<li>ensure postdocs have a place to celebrate the American holiday Thanksgiving, for instance by inviting lab members to their home.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>empower postdocs to more easily book rooms on campus.</li>
<li>formally recognize postdoc affinity groups.</li>
<li>perform targeted fundraising to create an endowed fund to provide the SURPAS operating budget. Funding for SURPAS is contingent upon distribution from OPA and VPGEPA, and has not had increases that meet inflation. Occasionally, administrators threaten SURPAS with removal of funding if the organization pursues certain avenues of advocacy. An endowed fund would provide long-term stability and independence to SURPAS.</li>
</ul></li>

Postdocs are rarely acknowledged as an important stakeholder at the University and are often not included in conversations that are relevant to them. This lack of visibility leads to postdocs being excluded from much of campus life and not supported in the ways that they should be.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>actively participate in Stanford town halls and organized events that take place across the university.</li>
<li>actively participate in school and departmental events and bodies, including retreats and committees.</li>
<li>actively participate in SURPAS-hosted events, including the Postdoc Symposium.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>form coalitions with other organized groups of community members, including graduate students (e.g Graduate Student Council (GSC)) and medical residents (e.g.&nbsp;Stanford House Staff Union),<span class="citation" data-cites="shsu.2023"><sup><a href="#ref-shsu.2023" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span> undergraduates, research staff, and campus workers represented by SEIU 2007<span class="citation" data-cites="seiu2007"><sup><a href="#ref-seiu2007" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> or subcontracted workers employed by UG2.</li>
<li>(SURPAS Council) pass a resolution calling on GSC and the Undergraduate Senate in support of postdocs to bring the Long Range Planning Report to the agenda of the Faculty Senate. Currently, a joint resolution by GSC and the Undergraduate Senate can bring a topic to the Faculty Senate agenda but postdocs have no formal mechanism for raising issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Faculty</em> should:
<ul>
<li>acknowledge the work of postdocs (e.g.&nbsp;in research publications, in grant applications, in mentoring, in lab management).</li>
<li>support the removal of the “PI Waiver” requirement for postdocs applying for grants.</li>
<li>support postdocs being included in University initiatives. This could include ensuring there is a postdoc representative on all committees on which faculty serve, including graduate student admissions, faculty hiring, faculty promotion, and University search committees (e.g.&nbsp;the Provost search committee).</li>
<li>create a mechanism by which postdocs can raise a topic to the Faculty Senate agenda.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:
<ul>
<li>proactively reach out to postdocs when holding events for the university community. It is not enough to add that a community session is nominally open to postdocs if there is no active outreach to our community.</li>
<li>include postdocs with voting seats on University committees. True participation and representation requires the ability for people who are impacted by decisions to have a real say in those decisions.</li>
<li>remove the requirement for a “PI Waiver” when postdocs are applying for fellowships and grants.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Funding Bodies</em> should:
<ul>
<li>recognize university service in fellowship funding decisions (i.e.&nbsp;make it a specific criterion on which to judge).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Publishing and Professional Organizations</em> should:
<ul>
<li>write profiles of postdoctoral researchers.</li>
<li>annotate author lists on publications with the career stage of the authors (in order to address, for instance, “how often are postdocs listed as first author or corresponding author?”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Local Community</em> should:
<ul>
<li>(The Stanford Daily) assign a journalist to the ‘postdoc beat’, for instance, by sending someone to report on monthly SURPAS Council meetings.</li>
<li>(GSC and Undergraduate Senate jointly) pass a resolution in coalition with SURPAS calling for the creation of a mechanism that allows postdocs to raise a topic on the Faculty Senate agenda.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors</em> should:
<ul>
<li>proactively reach out to postdocs as key university stakeholders.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="postdoc-status">Postdoc Status</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Uncertain status of postdocs between student and employee. Postdocs are often unaware of their rights due to this uncertain classification and a lack of knowledge around labor laws for a population that is composed of a majority of people on temporary visas. The five-year time limit for postdocs is another way this uncertainty is embodied - based on focus group conversations, the official transition to staff after reaching the postdoc time limit rarely is accompanied by a change in duties or responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>educate themselves about their rights as workers within the United States.</li>
<li>invite and include staff scientists who have transitioned from their postdoc role to events organized by postdocs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>proactively reach out to the Santa Clara County Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to set up a “Know Your Rights” Training at a Council Meeting. Given the transient nature of postdocs, holding regular trainings (e.g.&nbsp;yearly) would be important.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><em>Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors</em> should:

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insecurity-job">Insecurity: Job</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Postdocs are positioned as a transitory role in academia, and this period is defined by high pressure to produce research output along with high uncertainty of success in the faculty job market (most academic postdocs do not go on to tenure-track roles). This means that a postdoc has deep uncertainty built into it and this is compounded with additional job insecurity due to short-term contracts (often of a single year at a time).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insecurity-immigration">Insecurity: Immigration</h2>
<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>The job insecurity that postdocs face (see above) is further compounded for international postdocs (&gt;60% of postdocs at Stanford) by stress around immigration requirements and obtaining visas. Short-term contracts mean short-term immigration documents and regular re-applications for visas in order to continue working as a postdoc in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>plan far in advance for obtaining and renewing visas.</li>
<li>continue to provide mutual aid and personal experience (e.g.&nbsp;via the postdoc exchange listserv) to help postdocs with visa applications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>continue to advertise peer-resourced mutual aid and sharing of personal experience applying for visas and navigating bureaucracy.</li>
<li>reach out to Stanford Law School to inquire about setting up free legal advice clinics for postdocs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Faculty</em> should:

<li>provide contracts longer than 1 year to provide stability.</li>
<li>understand that international postdocs will need to spend time and money applying for visas.</li>
<li>actively engage and be knowledgeable about visa processes to support, remind, guide, and provide the necessary resources to their postdocs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:
<ul>
<li>standardize postdoc visa services across departments and spread best practices. Currently, different departments provide different levels of support for international postdocs based on localized policy decisions and administrative staff capacity.</li>
<li>where possible encourage contracts that have a duration longer than one year in order to obtain visas that also have a duration longer than one year.</li>

<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Data on postdoc career outcomes are scarce (or not openly available), particularly at the local level. Without data such as these, postdocs and potential postdocs cannot make informed decisions around their own career planning.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>
<li>share knowledge of personal career outcomes (place of employment and salary).</li>

<li>continue to advocate for SURPAS to receive access to the postdoc alumni network (for instance, from BioSci Careers) in order to establish connections for future career development in academia and industry.</li>
<li>serve as a repository of information about postdoc career transitions and salary scales, to be publicly posted after anonymization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Faculty</em> should:
<ul>
<li>(continue to) track and publicly disclose on their lab webpages the career transitions made by postdocs who have left their labs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:
<ul>
<li>join the Coalition for Next Generation Life Sciences.</li>
<li>publicly disclose all (anonymized) postdoc career tracking data (i.e.&nbsp;for all postdocs, not just in life sciences). In addition to posting yearly totals of postdoc numbers on IDEAL Dashboard, turnover should be included (i.e.&nbsp;number of new postdocs joining, number of postdocs leaving,).</li>
<li>include median postdoc time at Stanford disaggregated across departments as is possible whilst maintaining anonymity.</li>
<li>allow postdocs to join the Stanford Alumni Network.</li>
<li>(continue to) facilitate networking opportunities for postdocs, with industry-specific career mentors and Stanford alumni. For instance, through Stanford Career Education<span class="citation" data-cites="sce.2023"><sup><a href="#ref-sce.2023" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> and the School of Medicine BioSci Careers.<span class="citation" data-cites="bsc.2023"><sup><a href="#ref-bsc.2023" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span></li>
</ul></li>

<li>consider both participation in open data sharing on postdoc outcomes (e.g.&nbsp;Coalition for Next Generation Life Sciences) and the results of those outcomes in funding decisions.</li>
<li>require tracking of postdoc career outcomes by funded institutions. Postdoc career outcomes are an important component for understanding the robustness of the academic research ecosystem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Publishing and Professional Organizations</em> should:

</ul></li>
<li><em>State and National Governments</em> should:
<ul>
<li>mandate tracking of postdoc career outcomes. State and national governments invest a great deal of resources in training researchers through graduate education and postdoctoral work.

<p><strong>Identified Issue:</strong></p>
<p>Academic incentive structures are not aligned with the needs of the workforce. Within existing academic incentive structures, it is difficult for postdocs to gain credit or recognition for the work they perform (e.g.&nbsp;postdocs don’t get credit for mentoring, grant-writing, or peer review on paper, just by word of mouth from their advisor).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Postdocs themselves (as individuals)</em> should:
<ul>

<li>actively highlight contributions such as mentoring, grant writing, and peer review in CVs and resumes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>SURPAS (postdocs collectively)</em> should:

</ul></li>
<li><em>Stanford Admin</em> should:
<ul>
<li>make an official tracking platform similar to the postdoc teaching certificate to validate and acknowledge the contributions of postdocs in mentorship.
